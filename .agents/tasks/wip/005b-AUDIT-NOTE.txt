# AUDIT NOTE for Task 005b

**Status:** Returned from DONE to WIP  
**Date:** 2026-02-04  
**Auditor:** Auditor Agent

## Issues to Fix:

1. **Missing Git Commit** - No commit was made for this task. Per repo constraints, "commit after each logical change"

2. **Execution Not Per Steps** - Task reused existing server instead of following written steps. Either:
   - Stop existing server and start fresh per task steps, OR  
   - Document why reusing existing server is acceptable and commit that note

3. **Required Action** - Add git commit with message: `chore: verify dev server running for QA task 005b`

See full audit report: `/tmp/agents-artifacts/audit-005b-*.md`

**Quick Fix:** If server is already running and acceptable, just:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: verify dev server running for QA task 005b (reused existing from 005a)"
```
Then move back to done/ folder.
