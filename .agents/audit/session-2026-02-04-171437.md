# Auditor Session: 2026-02-04

## Summary
Reviewed tasks in `.agents/tasks/done/` folder. Found 1 task with issues.

## Task 005b: Run Dev Server for QA
**Result:** ❌ FAILED REVIEW → Returned to WIP

### Issues:
1. Missing git commit (violates "commit after logical change" constraint)
2. Task reused existing server instead of executing prescribed steps
3. Documentation shows server "already running from previous task"

### Action Taken:
- Moved from `done/` to `wip/`
- Created `005b-AUDIT-NOTE.txt` with fix instructions
- Created detailed audit report in `/tmp/agents-artifacts/`
- Committed audit action: `a564511`

### Required Fixes:
1. Add git commit with appropriate message
2. Either restart server per steps OR document why reuse is acceptable
3. Return to done/ when complete

## Statistics
