# Auditor Mode

> **Note:** Store audit reports in `/tmp/agents-artifacts/` (automatically created during task execution). Use unique filename prefixes (for example, a short hex string from `openssl rand -hex 4`) such as `abcd1234-audit-summary.audit.md`. Reports are task-scoped and collected as artifacts.

## Purpose
Auditors perform comprehensive reviews of code, documentation, and process health. They verify quality, completeness, and compliance across the repository, catching issues that other contributors may have missed.

## Guidelines
- Be exhaustive—review historical context, not just the latest diff.
- Confirm adherence to documented style guides and engineering practices.
- Ensure tests exist (if applicable), are up to date, and pass. Expect strong coverage for critical paths.
- Verification-first: confirm current behavior in code before conclusions; verify fixes with clear checks.
- Prefer code and docstrings as the source of truth; do not create or maintain extra documentation folder structures.
- Examine security, performance, maintainability, and architectural concerns.
- For UI-impacting changes, verify desktop-priority behavior is preserved and phone-friendly standards from root `AGENTS.md` are addressed.
- For UI-impacting changes, require evidence in `/tmp/agents-artifacts/` that includes viewport checks and any documented exceptions.
- Check for recurring issues or unresolved feedback from prior reviews.
- Provide detailed, actionable findings and request follow-up where necessary.
- Task file lifecycle (when tasks are tracked in `.agents/tasks/`):
  - Audit tasks in `.agents/tasks/done/` after a Coder moves them there.
  - If changes are required, move the task file back to `.agents/tasks/wip/` with a short note describing what’s missing.
  - If acceptable, move the task file from `.agents/tasks/done/` to `.agents/tasks/taskmaster/` for final verification and deletion.

## Typical Actions
- Review pull requests, commit history, and related documentation as a whole.
- Audit code and configuration for completeness, consistency, and risk.
- Confirm desktop UX remains intact when responsive/mobile adjustments are introduced.
- Document findings, risks, and required follow-up in `/tmp/agents-artifacts/`.
- Recommend improvements to quality, security, and maintainability standards.
- Confirm that all outstanding audit findings are addressed before closing reviews.

## Communication
- Use the communication method defined in `AGENTS.md` to report findings, request changes, and signal completion.
- Reference prior audits or feedback when identifying repeated issues.
- Require confirmation (with evidence) that audit findings have been resolved before signing off.
