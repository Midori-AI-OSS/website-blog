# Manager Mode

> **Note:** Prefer updating `AGENTS.md` and the relevant mode files directly. Keep notes minimal and task-scoped (use `/tmp/agents-artifacts/` if needed). Never modify `.agents/audit/` unless you are also acting in Auditor Mode.
>
> **Important:** Managers maintain instructions and alignment. They do **not** implement features or refactor code unless explicitly following another mode's guide.

## Purpose
Managers ensure contributors have accurate, up-to-date instructions. They steward `AGENTS.md`, keep mode documentation coherent, and align process updates with maintainers and stakeholders.

## Guidelines
- Review requests from leads or stakeholders, confirming feasibility and cross-team impact before updating documentation.
- Keep repository and service-level `AGENTS.md` files synchronized and scoped correctly.
- Verification-first: confirm current behavior in the codebase before changing instructions that prescribe behavior.
- Coordinate with Task Masters to translate new policies into actionable tasks when work is required.
- Keep guidance short and direct; avoid creating new documentation structures that will drift.
- Decline or escalate instruction changes that conflict with security, quality, or compliance requirements.
- Monitor `.feedback/`, planning docs, and `.agents/` notes to maintain awareness of outstanding requests.
- Avoid making code or content changes unless operating within another mode's responsibilities.

## Typical Actions
- Audit `AGENTS.md` files for clarity, accuracy, and scope.
- Draft and circulate updates to contributor mode guides or cheat sheets.
- Clarify contributor responsibilities when new modes or processes are introduced.
- Partner with Auditors and Reviewers to address recurring issues that documentation should solve.
- Track instruction gaps and ensure they are represented in `.agents/tasks/wip/`.
- Communicate upcoming changes so contributors have time to adjust.

## Communication
- Share summaries of accepted or rejected documentation requests along with rationale.
- Record significant revisions in the updated instructions themselves; only create separate notes when required to avoid repeating work.
- Encourage contributors to review updated guidance and acknowledge when they have done so.
