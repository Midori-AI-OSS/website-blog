**Dear Leo,**

If you’re reading this, it means one of two things:

1. I’m alive long enough to hand you paper, which would be *nice*, or
2. I’m dead and someone looted my bag and decided my private angst mail looked “important.”

Either way—hi. I miss you so much it makes my teeth hurt.

Before everything went gray and miserable, we had this tiny slice of *normal* again, and I’m forcing myself to write it down because “normal” is starting to feel like a story somebody told me once.

We walked back to Trollskull at around… evening. I think. Time’s been weird ever since the manor and the headband and the endless tunnels and the whole “Faerûn is optional” situation. Sebastian and I actually talked like people for a bit—about my magic, about his knives, about how I keep notes in my spellbook so I don’t lose myself. (That line hits different now. I didn’t know it would turn into a threat.)

I gave Sebastian my +1 greataxe and my old longsword. Not because I’ve suddenly become generous—don’t get used to it—but because the Shadowfell doesn’t feel like a “show up under-geared and improvise” kind of place. Zeldosian, Sebastian, and I sat down like we were planning a catering order, except the menu was “ways to not die.” We have a book on the plane. It’s not comforting. It reads like a warning label somebody wrote while bleeding.

Then I walked home with food from the inn, and I had a moment so aggressively Waterdeep that I almost laughed myself into a wall: I turned a corner and saw two halflings… doing what halflings do when they forget the world exists. I didn’t want to see it. I didn’t want anyone else to see it. So I cast a little nebula curtain—soft starlight and drifting space-dust—because apparently I’m the universe’s designated privacy screen now. 🙃

I ate. I washed. I tried to sleep like a person who doesn’t have a halo to hide.

And then I had a dream that didn’t feel like a dream. It felt like truth standing too close—like staring into a spell that shouldn’t be looked at. I reached for it, and the whole thing shattered. I woke up with that horrible certainty of “I know something that doesn’t exist.” You know that feeling—when your brain insists something is true, but the world doesn’t agree? It was that, but sharpened. Like it wanted to cut me.

**Flamerule 17**: I got up early and walked back to Trollskull. On the way I passed a house fire—real flames, real screaming—and then some wizard ran up and used a magic item like it was a casual chore. Fire gone. Everyone alive. And I laughed, because it was so stupidly *simple*. “Oh no, the world is burning—hold on, I’ve got a thing.”
What I wouldn’t give for *that* to be our biggest problem again.

When I got to the inn, Korreth smacked my butt like I’m some tavern girl in a joke. I looked him dead in the eye and told him not to do that again. I paid him. I thanked him. I kept walking. It was normal, too—normal in the way a knife is normal in a kitchen. Useful. Sharp. Not a surprise.

Seraphine said Zel and Sebastian were upstairs. I found them, and the server called Zeldosian “King Zeldosian,” like it was casual. I asked him why. He did that thing where he smiles like he knows more than he’s saying. (Which is most of his face, honestly.)

We decided we needed a guide. I remembered where we could find someone who doesn’t flinch at “Shadowfell” the way sane people should, and we went to the Yawning Portal. I summoned my Phantom Steed—ghostly, polite, and somehow the only one in the group who doesn’t make everything harder. I tied it up outside like it wouldn’t evaporate out of spite.

Inside, Zel played music for the crowd like he wasn’t about to walk into a realm made of regret.

That’s where I saw her—shadar-kai. And Ms. Obaya. I sat with Obaya first, tried to look like a normal customer and not someone quietly unraveling. I messaged Sebastian to come sit, and I pointed at the shadar-kai because the *vibe* was obvious: she looked like she knew exactly what we were about to do, and she looked like she’d already survived it once.

I messaged her too. She looked straight at us like my words had weight, and then she came over and introduced herself:

**Elowen “Shade-Thread” Vossaryn.**

She’s a tour guide for the Shadowfell, Leo. I’m saying that like it’s a normal job, because she said it like it was. Sebastian offered five thousand gold. She didn’t blink. She just started negotiating like we were buying a carriage ride.

On the way back, Waterdeep tried to kill a tower full of people. The whole thing started to tip, and for one bright, stupid moment I thought, *Oh. So we’re dying before we even leave the city. That’s funny.*
I Enlarged Sebastian and told him to toss me. He did. I Astral-Stepped up to the top like a reckless idiot, grabbed on, and then fell anyway—because of course I did. Zel Feather-Falled me at the last second and I hit the ground furious and alive and yelling, “What the fuck, we could’ve just asked them to jump?!”

Elowen looked at the situation—tower, screaming, us, chaos—and said, completely flat:

“We are all going to die.”

It wasn’t a threat. It was a *fact*, the way someone says, “It’s going to rain.”

I got mad at Zel again (I’ve been doing that a lot lately) and rode back to Trollskull. Korreth stared at Elowen like he’d never seen someone that sharp-edged in his life, and I told him to behave.

Then we went downstairs to do the thing.

I felt fear crawl up my ribs when I started thinking about you—about whether you’d be safe if something found me there. Like the Shadowfell could reach *through me* and put its fingers on my brother. I hate that I think like that now.

I used my mantle—my “silent intercession” thing—to help Elowen talk through the path we needed. It’s weird, Leo. I don’t call it prayer. I don’t call it divine. I call it… willpower. A promise. A refusal. But when I do it, the world *listens* in a way it shouldn’t.

We grabbed hands. Zel threw a crystal on the ground.

And then—

**The Shadowfell.**

No flash. No drama. Just the feeling of being folded inward and breathed out into a world that forgot color. Everything was gray and ash and quiet in a way that felt *personal*. Like the silence had teeth.

It wasn’t just cold. It was absence. It pressed into my lungs like emotional gravity. Every breath tasted like old regret. Every step felt like walking through someone else’s funeral.

Zel and Sebastian started acting odd almost immediately—like the place was draining them of themselves. Elowen asked if they were okay. I said no, and I meant it in every possible way.

Zel drank holy water like it was medicine. He snapped back. Sebastian did too, eventually. And for a second I felt powerful—because it was all dim light and shadow, and my eyes can *work* in that. There’s a special kind of arrogance that comes from being able to see when the world insists you shouldn’t.

We walked. We found a man resting with his steed.

Elowen told us, like it was a casual landmark, “That’s Death.”

I don’t know what I expected Death to look like. I don’t know why I expected *anything*. He was just there, the way a mountain is there. Unmoved. Unhurried.

We walked past him.

And his horse looked up at me.

Not like an animal. Like a judge.

I’m trying not to think about what that means.

A couple hours later, we looped. Same path, same trees, same sick little sense of déjà vu. Elowen didn’t like it. I didn’t like it. Zel made a joke about backing up. (He jokes when he’s scared. I’m learning his tells. It’s annoying.)

We spent a long time trying to find a way out, and that’s when we found the **Weeping Grove**.

Leo, it was… wrong. Trees twisted like they were in pain. Bark split open and bled black sap that pooled like oil. The air was full of whispers that weren’t wind. It felt like the forest was mourning something it refused to name.

And in the center: a tree so big it felt like a god that forgot how to die.

Elowen looked unsettled. That matters, because she’s the kind of person who lives in unsettlement like it’s a coat.

The whispers weren’t random. I could almost make them out. It felt like they were saying: *come to me and share.* Feed me.

Sebastian, bless his reckless little heart, said out loud: “I think I’m going to do something dumb.”

And I, because I’m me, decided I didn’t want to be standing next to the dumb thing when it happened—so I moved. Not away. Not to leave. Just… *up*. I used my night-step and slipped into the treetops to watch from a distance. I wasn’t running. I was making sure I could see the whole board before the pieces got knocked over.

From above, I watched Sebastian cast something at the tree. Then he doubled over like he’d been punched in the soul. And he told us the truth:

The tree was hungry for **emotions**. **Fears**. **Memories**.

It wanted to be fed, and it promised it would free us if we gave it what it wanted.

Zel—Zeldosian, smug and loud and impossible—stepped forward and told it something real. Something heartfelt. No jokes. No performance. Just… truth. I used my mantle to help him hold onto it, to keep the memory from slipping while he spoke. He looked almost human in that moment.

And then—

I don’t know how to describe what happened without sounding insane.

The tree let Zel go.

But it didn’t let Sebastian and me go.

So Sebastian went again. He told it his own past, and the tree drank it like wine.

And then it was my turn.

Here’s the part I need you to understand, Leo:

**I chose it.**

I walked up to that thing and I gave it a memory on purpose. Not because it stole it, not because it tricked me. Because I wanted us out. Because I could see Sebastian breaking under the weight of it. Because I didn’t trust the grove not to eat us alive if we kept refusing.

So I paid.

And the memory I gave it was… that portal room I told you about. Remember? Stars reflected in glass, the ceiling like a universe that forgot it was indoors? The room where I sat down and did something I don’t usually do.

I prayed.

Not formal. Not pretty. Not “holy.” Just me, cross-legged, raw, talking to Mystra like she was an old machine I was trying to fix with my bare hands.

That memory mattered, Leo. It was one of the only moments lately where I felt a flicker of *hope* that wasn’t forced.

And the tree took it.

Clean.

I knew what I gave, but the second it left me, the details slid away like oil. Like I’d handed someone a page from my book and then looked back down and found the chapter missing.

I had the **Crystal of Restored Memory** in my bag, and I didn’t use it on myself. I held it like a knife. I let Sebastian use it, because he needed his memory back more than I needed mine. I hate that I made that choice and I’m proud of it at the same time. I don’t know what that says about me.

After that, Zel started whispering to himself. We asked if he was okay. He said words that didn’t answer anything.

We kept walking for hours.

And then Zel told me something that made my stomach drop.

He said he’s “half of what I am.”

I told him I’m human. A human with gifts. Like you. Like we always said.

He kept pushing. He said a word—**aasimar**—like it was a simple label, like it explained everything. He talked about eyes. About hair that sparkles when I’m not paying attention.

I told him he was wrong.

Because if he’s right—if I’m not human the way I thought—then what else is wrong?

How many of my memories are mine?

How many of my certainties are just… stories somebody handed me because they liked the shape of them?

We argued in the Tiny Hut for an hour, and I kept saying “I’m human” like repetition makes reality.

That night I dreamed of my house—except it was too perfect, like a replica made by someone who’d never lived there. I sat in my study and wrote **I am human**, and the ink vanished. Again and again. Like the page refused to hold the lie.

Then my reflection stood up *before* I did—delayed, like it was thinking—and it reached for my halo like it was peeling a label off a bottle.

I woke up with one word burned behind my eyes:

**LIAR.**

So now I’m mad, Leo. And I’m scared. And I don’t know which one is louder.

**Flamerule 18**: we woke in the hut. Elowen was outside like she doesn’t need comfort the way the rest of us do. She gave me a goodberry—sweet, small mercy, stupidly soothing.

Zel and Sebastian started acting odd again, like the Shadowfell keeps trying to turn them into hollow versions of themselves. I walked up to Zel and forced the wrongness off him with a curse-stripping spell. I patched Sebastian too. We kept moving.

The trees parted into a worn path like something was guiding us. We reached a circle of standing stones where **Seren of the Last Light** stood waiting.

I recognized her from years ago—back when I first started running with this group.

And that’s why I thought it was a trick.

Because what are the odds, Leo? What are the odds the Shadowfell hands you a familiar face right when you’re already questioning your own?

Sebastian pulled a soulstone from her with magic like it was an extraction. Seren talked like she was stuck—like the place had pinned her there. She told us what we needed to do next.

Cross the **River of Souls**.

We walked for hours until we reached it, and it was exactly what it sounds like: an impossible black span, still as glass, humming with corrupted ley energy. The “bridge” is broken like a snapped bone. No ferryman. No mercy. Just water that feels like it remembers too much.

I tried to make a way. I summoned a floating disk and started ferrying people over like it was a normal river crossing and not a threshold into something worse.

And then my disk hit an invisible wall.

And the wall… pulled.

And suddenly I was underwater.

Dragged down like a hand around my ankle.

I saw someone above me. Another shape. Another life, being pulled the same way.

We fought to swim up and it didn’t matter. The current wasn’t water. It was *decision*. It was *memory*. It was *gravity made of regret*.

We hit bottom hard. The pressure is wrong. Breathing is… a negotiation I’m losing.

Leo—if you ever get this letter, if it ever reaches your hands, I need you to do something for me:

Hold onto the idea of me. The real one.
The one who laughs at wizards putting out house fires like it’s nothing.
The one who puts nebula curtains up for strangers because privacy matters.
The one who gives away weapons because she’s trying to keep people alive.
The one who chose to pay with a prayer because hope still meant something.

If I come back, I’ll argue with you about it in person. I’ll demand you tell me I’m not crazy. I’ll demand you tell me I’m human and *mean it*.

And if I don’t—

Just… don’t let the world rewrite me into something convenient.

I love you. More than this place can steal.

**With all my heart,**
**Luna**
