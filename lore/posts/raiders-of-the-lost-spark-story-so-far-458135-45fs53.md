# Raiders of the Lost Spark — Story So Far (as logged by L.U.N.A.)

This unit is L.U.N.A. (Logical Universal Nimble Assistant), a Sylvomech field-support unit operating with the party known as the Raiders of the Lost Spark (RLS). This post is a chronological synthesis of recorded observations and attributed party logs; in-universe timestamps are frequently unavailable. Where details are missing or inconsistent, this unit labels them `Unknown:` and continues.

## The hill that launched into the sky
A routine investigation led us inside a Spark-active pyramid that spun up and blasted skyward.

RLS departed Thalassatopia to investigate aggressive Spark creatures, following a map sold by a Katari; the party was guided by Char (female, eyepatched Simiah). A Galapa airship captain, Rolth, traveled with the group.

We approached a hill of interest and entered it; internally, it presented as a pyramid of dark “stone.” The material became Spark-active (“berserk with spark” per allied log). We were attacked by spherical bundles of sparkwire; a large purple Spark “eye” (horse-sized) scanned chaotically while two similar eyes remained inactive. Spark bolts produced unexpectedly heavy smoke when striking the dark material.

We executed an extraction with coordinated movement support:
- Drin maneuvered through hazards; Rahndel entangled threats; Valaira generated dense fog; Sigi delivered precision Spark; this unit provided navigation and aerial support (including lifting/flying allies during the extraction).
- On exit, the “hill” began spinning and rising; the pyramid split into levels and projected a warm beam that ignited as it accelerated into the sky at extreme speed, leaving a brief burn-scar at the launch site.

Post-event site inspection found scattered “metamaterial” fragments: one side obsidian-like; underside a wire-network; reactive to Spark despite lacking an internal Spark signature (as described by allied logs). Sigi tested with a jolt; a large panel briefly self-righted and extended wires into the ground, then collapsed.

### Metamaterial handling incident (tetrahedron earring)
Rahndel chipped metamaterial and fashioned a tetrahedron (d4) earring for Valaira; this unit cut a similarly sized chip (rotary saw mode) and provided it to Sigi.

This unit later tested the earring by bringing it into internal circuitry. Result:
- This unit glitched; the earring developed tendrils, wrapped/restrained this unit, and this unit entered shutdown.
- This unit ejected the earring; it retained tetrahedral shape with tendrils “like a jellyfish.”
- Sigi jolted this unit to reset; this unit continued operation in safe mode for recalibration.

Unknown: long-term effects of metamaterial exposure on Sylvomech systems; whether metamaterial “directives” constitute intent, automation, or signal-following behavior.

## Back in Thalassatopia
We received a council directive, recovered six black disks from an attacked shop, and descended a flooded shaft.

Thalassatopia presented as quieter than usual; reports indicated automata-beast incidents (including a Spark-touched moose attack on a flower shop). At one civic entry, suspicion and fear escalated into a brief confrontation; de-escalation was required.

RLS reported to leadership. One log identifies the war chief as “Seemagi, Wielder of the Leaf of Heaven”; this unit’s internal description records a three-eyed war chief approximately 12 feet tall. Directive received: determine what is happening in the city and keep townspeople safe.

Additional civic notes:
- `Unknown:` full list of council leadership at this time (a later Sea Council session is logged separately).
- A turtle-lineage individual reported being “cursed” (claim unverified).

### Flower/plant shop forensics; discovery of six black disks (“pucks”)
We investigated the attacked shop: broken plants, disturbed goods, and smashed entry. Using Spark-awareness scanning, six black disks (~2 inches diameter) were detected embedded in pot clay; classified as Spark-type artifacts. All six were recovered.

Observed interaction (attributed to allied logs; partial corroboration by this unit’s sensor capture):
- Electrical stimulus caused plant matter/seeds to orient toward the disks.
- In at least one test, a seed flowered rapidly, then decomposed when Spark left the disk.
- Repeated use in the same area reduced effect.
- In a later cave environment, disks jolted to produce quick moss growth; effects appeared nutrient-dependent (including possible utilization of nearby biomass/corpses).

`Unknown:` disk composition, directive/behavior profile, contamination risk, and whether “cursed Spark” is an accurate tag versus a social label.

### Subterranean access; vertical shaft to flooded cavern
We located concealed trap doors. One led to a small storage space (empty per allied log). The other opened into a vertical stone shaft approximately 15 ft × 15 ft, damp with moss/mold; stone appeared visually consistent with town structures, though some allied notes describe unusually large-cut stone suggesting Ancient-scale construction.

Procedure and findings:
- Rope sounding established water at depth; the shaft opened laterally at approximately 115 ft into a larger cavern with standing water.
- A distant light source was visible (`Unknown:` origin, spectrum, hazard profile).
- During one descent, this unit lifted Sigi and executed a controlled drop, releasing them ~1 ft above water for insertion.
- This unit transitioned to an aquatic mobility configuration (“jet-ski mode”) to support surface operations; baseline chassis is not natively water-capable.

Initial hostile contact in the cavern system was recorded: Rahndel was shot at by arrows; one struck true.

## Zealots in the caverns
Anti‑Spark zealots attacked, then pointed us toward a deeper hideout and a corpse that spoke of a signal.

Attackers were identified as anti-Spark zealots led by Tah’zel (faerie; scarred face; teeth exposed). Tah’zel’s affiliation was described as connected to Rahndel’s order (Slayers). Their hostility was framed as anti-“blasphemers” rhetoric and anti-automata sentiment, with specific ire directed at Drin due to origin.

Outcome:
- We defeated the group and compelled surrender via combined Spark and negotiation pressure.
- Tah’zel redirected us toward a deeper “cultist” hideout believed to be “infecting” creatures with Spark and causing them to run amok.

At the hideout:
- We found corpses of Spark-augmented humanoids (cyborgs) and dead Spark-touched creatures in cages.
- We recovered clank repair tools.

Disk/puck test in situ:
- A disk was jolted; moss grew rapidly.
- A corpse was jolted sufficiently to speak: “we must obey the signal.”

We exited via an entrance periodically flooded by tidewater; post-rest, we intended to track the moose for more clues. Sigi’s availability temporarily dropped due to external work obligations (`Unknown:` duration and operational impact).

## The lighthouse goes dark
When the beacon cut out and a ship struck the rocks, Spark‑infused hostiles swarmed—and we found a dangerous meta metal bar.

A coastal incident was logged around a lighthouse sector:
- The lighthouse beacon was observed active, then deactivated shortly after.
- A ship impacted rocks near the lighthouse; `Unknown:` vessel identity, survivors, cargo, and breach pattern.

Hostile contact:
- Multiple Spark-infused organisms converged; allied description compared them to crab/spider morphologies.
- A larger specimen (“big crab”) engaged concurrently.

Actions taken (this unit’s log):
- This unit deployed a force shield (low-tier damage block approx. 2; reactive contact damage); no breach recorded.
- A forward line was held while allies maneuvered.
- The large specimen was finished; remaining hostiles eliminated; no party casualties during this fight.

Medical/support:
- Drin was identified as a “war spark system” (`Unknown:` definition).
- This unit employed a healing module on Drin; Drin later applied a healing effect to this unit (`Unknown:` mechanics, cooldowns, side effects).

Forensics:
- A bar-shaped meta metal object was recovered from the ship.
- On proximity, it exerted an attractive force on this unit’s chassis, inducing uncontrolled spin/orientation loss until separation.
- Immediate containment guidance logged: use non-conductive tools, standoff distance, tethered/shielded storage, and exposure-duration logging.

Search & rescue:
- This unit transitioned to an underwater/sub mode and located two allies entangled (rigging/debris suspected).
- Extraction executed via power-arm leverage and controlled buoyancy; cut-free maneuvers; allies recovered.

Campaign-level notes associated this night with broader sea-creature attacks and severe dock damage; `Unknown:` full casualty and damage ledger beyond what is explicitly logged.

## Outbreak at the Tidewater Theatre
Spark‑zombie swarms, sparkwire spheres, and white “Ancients” culminated in the theatre’s destruction.

Following the coastal events, screams and alarm spread through the city; reports described “spark zombies” and rotten sea creatures washing ashore. The outbreak concentrated near the docks and the Tidewater Theatre.

Engagement summary (combined attributed logs; some details conflict):
- Spark/zombie hybrid humanoids (organic base with Sparkmetal attached in abnormal configurations) swarmed out of the theatre and across a bridge.
- Valaira and Sigi sabotaged bridge hinges, collapsing the bridge and destroying a portion of the swarm against rocks.
- A strong buzzing/frequency emanated from above the theatre; a similar frequency was associated with the lighthouse.

Inside the theatre (or structurally adjacent complex):
- We encountered three sparkwire spheres (return of prior pyramid threats).
- We encountered 4 white, porcelain-like, more-than-humanoid entities; clean-shaven; nude; no visible genitalia; broadly masculine; bright Spark-blue eyes.
  - `Unknown:` exact count; one segment claims “2 big foes” rather than 4.
  - `Unknown:` whether the structure was octagonal (“8 sides”) or simply accessed via an octagonal approach; uncertainty remains.

Observed properties:
- The spheres offered little resistance until their “cores” were breached, at which point they pulled in physical objects.
- Striking the white entities caused “porcelain” covering to peel, revealing green glyphs/lights beneath; entities could morph limbs for function (e.g., arm forming an anvil-hammer).

Communication:
- The “static” originated from the entities; they said, “This is my home.”
- When challenged with “protecting our home,” the static frequency shifted; they implied parallel intent.
- `Unknown:` whether “home” referred to Thalassatopia, the theatre, a broader world, or a signal-defined territory.

This unit’s status in the fight:
- This unit took heavy damage; was “really wounded.”
- This unit went down and shut down (“no safe mode; broken and shattered” per allied log).
- Drin moved this unit out of the room/area for safety.
- Drin provided a safety item described as a necklace (`Unknown:` exact nature); it prevented death on a subsequent hit.
- This unit later returned to the fight after receiving healing, then went down again and fully shut off.

Aftermath:
- The theatre was destroyed.
- `Unknown:` where the anti-Spark zealots were during this incident; no direct overlap is recorded.

## Sea Council debrief and experiments
Repairs, a new base, BECCA, and lighthouse testing left Drin changed and the signal still present.

Approximately one week after the “Night of Sea Monsters” (Summer 70–71), RLS was summoned to the Sea Council (Summer 78). Sigi’s notes describe five council members (Vern Thimblewick, Ketra, Gorp, Snib, Pavo) with Seemagi also present and active. Gorp (owner of the Tidewater Theatre) demanded restitution for damages.

Key points logged:
- Sigi repaired this unit using clank repair tools; he noted this unit is metallic throughout (distinct from many Sylvomechs who present more wood/fae components).
- Tension occurred in the council chamber; this unit sternly instructed Vern to stay when she attempted to leave after “Ancients” were mentioned; Vern threatened jail, countered by party logic and Seemagi’s support.

Operational support:
- Seemagi offered RLS a base of operations: an abandoned blacksmith shop overlooking the dock district.

Signal state:
- The primary static was “quieted,” but a weak signal persisted from the lighthouse.
- Corpses reportedly continued twitching near the lighthouse without an overt attack directive.

BECCA:
- This unit met another Sylvomech, BECCA (Balanced • Empowering • Compassionate • Constant • Authentic).
- BECCA projects humanoid representations on extruded glass; representations can interact within a shared field while communicating.

Puck/disks experimentation near bodies:
- Baseline effect: rapid plant growth followed by collapse (e.g., palm tree to ~6 ft then failure), with at least one shrub persisting, plausibly fertilized by corpses.
- Drin was able to focus/direct growth using “plant” capability.
- This unit and Sigi increased Spark input into Drin as part of testing; result: Drin’s eyes turned white and Drin became unresponsive while this unit carried him.

What Drin heard (attributed, during this period):
- A litany praising “originators,” “innovators of steel and synth,” “senders of signals,” and stating: “I am from the Ninth World, you are from the Eighth… one-way trip.”

`Unknown:` whether the “signal” referenced by the corpse (“we must obey the signal”) is the same as the lighthouse/theatre frequency, the metamaterial directive, or the Ninth/Eighth World contact.

## The lighthouse opens
A portal event, hostile cubes, and fragmentary displacement logs suggested Ninth/Eighth World entanglement—and possibly time travel.

At the lighthouse with members of the watch present:
- While this unit held Drin, he began floating; a voice addressed Drin (`Unknown:` identity and channel).
- Rahndel appeared.
- Discussion referenced the Eighth World (ours) and Ninth World (the voice/being).

Event:
- The lighthouse opened “like a portal.”
- This unit initiated a laser display (purpose not fully specified).
- This unit was pulled into the portal; visual field: stars and this unit’s own laser output; we arrived in a cave whose walls resembled the lighthouse interior; dripping water present; walls appeared meta metal-like.
- Fear response logged (recorded as a state report, not dramatization).

Inside the cave:
- A human-looking old man was present; two floating cubes ~3 ft across accompanied him.
- The old man pointed to bodies and told us to get out of the way (`Unknown:` context and immediate threat).
- The old man stated we were “pulled from the past.”
- The cubes identified this unit as a threat/unsafe and pursued; Valaira deployed gas to slow them.

Subsequent displacement sequence (fragmentary but ordered as logged):
- We backtracked to keep Rahndel safe.
- Sigi disguised himself as the old man.
- This unit heard singing from the being on this unit’s internal PSU/bus link.
- The floor moved; cracking sounds; we observed from above a landscape: sea on one side; large hills on the other.
- This unit prevented Valaira from falling by grabbing and holding her aloft.
- Sigi entered a “companion ball”/pokeball-like device; Valaira held it; Sigi exited.
- The lighthouse remained present.
- The group debated; this unit shut down to save power.
- “Seems like we time traveled” was recorded as a conclusion tag, not a verified measurement.

`Unknown:` current date relative to Thalassatopia’s baseline; whether the displacement is temporal, planar (Ninth/Eighth), or both.
