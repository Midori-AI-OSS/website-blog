## Luna’s Diary — “The Day the Water Tried to Keep Me”  
*(from our crossing into the Shadowfell through tonight)*

I didn’t want to come here.

I said it out loud, even. I said it with my mouth and my hands and every tiny flinch in my body that people pretend they don’t notice. I did not want the Shadowfell. I did not want the cold that doesn’t behave like cold. I did not want the grief that isn’t mine, but still crawls into my ribs like it owns the place. I did not want to follow Calathar’s trail into a plane that feels like it was built to teach you what you’ve lost—over and over—until you stop caring.

But we *did*.

And I hate that part of me is still proud that we did it anyway. Like bravery is supposed to taste noble instead of bitter.

I keep thinking about the “normal” pieces. The stupid little normal pieces that should not matter, but do.

Warm air inside the hut.  
Ink on my fingers.  
A bed that does not try to eat me.  
My books.  
My familiar landing on my arm like I’m something safe.  
Even the way Waterdeep smells compared to this place—bread and salt and smoke and *life*.

I remember those things like you hold a candle in a storm.

Because this place would rather I forget what “normal” even means.

### The crossing (or whatever it was)
I don’t know how to write this part cleanly, because it didn’t feel like a door.

It felt like… a *lurch*.

Like the world grabbed my stomach and twisted.

Like being pulled through a memory that wasn’t mine, and coming out the other side with my lungs full of panic.

Maybe that’s the point. Maybe you don’t “arrive” here. Maybe you just… *fail to remain somewhere else.*

And then the next thing I knew—

### Water.
Black water.

The same river. The same one that always feels wrong, like it’s not water so much as a thought that learned how to drown people.

I started underwater, and the first thing I felt was fear so sharp it was almost clean. Simple. Honest.

*I don’t want to die like this.*

I kicked upward, slow at first because terror makes you stupid. Then faster, because terror also makes you stubborn.

There was darkness tugging at me like hands. Not a creature—at least, not one I saw. Just the pull. Like the river wanted me to become part of it.

I saw Sebastian take hard damage. I heard shouting. I saw chaos above me like shapes behind glass.

I tried to reach for the disk—my disk, the same one as last time, my little moving island of *please don’t let me touch the ground here*—and my wet hands slipped off my staff.

Sebastian grabbed me.

I hate that I needed that. I hate how much I needed that.

I got onto the disk and almost passed out just from breathing air again, like my body couldn’t decide if it was allowed to live.

I started drying my clothes with Prestidigitation because I needed something normal to do with my hands. Something small. Something *mine*. Something that wasn’t “panic.”

That’s when I heard about the dwarf.

Boris Bunk.

I hadn’t even met him yet and I already felt… wrong. Not “evil,” not exactly. Just *odd*. Like a tone your ear doesn’t like.

And then—almost immediately—he was gone from the story as fast as he arrived, like this plane itself shrugged him off.

That’s how it goes here, I guess.
People become “was.”

---

### “You’re the reason”
Sebastian made a comment that I was the reason we got pulled under.

And I told him “fuck you.”

But—important detail—I meant it the way you mean it when you’re trying not to cry. The way you mean it when you need your friend to stop talking like the world is a courtroom.

I understood the joke. I think he understood I understood it.

Still… it landed where it landed.

Because I’m tired of being blamed for things that happen *to* me.

I am tired of the world acting like my existence is a hazard sign.

And I am tired of pretending that doesn’t hurt.

---

### The rune pillars and the bridge that only listens to violence (and mercy)
There were rune pillars rising out of the river like broken teeth. Carved symbols, sick-looking magic. The kind that makes your eyes itch even when you’re pretending you’re fine.

The bridge advanced when we interacted with them the “right” way.

And of course the “right” way is stupid.

Some needed to be attacked.  
Some needed to be healed.

Like the Shadowfell itself is a lesson written by someone smug:
> *“See? Even cruelty is a key. Even kindness is a weapon. Isn’t that clever?”*

Boris attacked one. The bridge advanced.

I Magic Missiled another. The bridge advanced.

And then—because apparently the universe wanted to laugh directly into my mouth—I used Cure Wounds on one.

Healing a pillar. Healing a *thing*.  
And it worked.

So yes. I healed a rock to move forward in the land of despair.

If Leo could see me now he would either laugh or look at me with that quiet expression that means he’s filing the moment away for later, so he can tease me when I’m safe.

I miss him so much it makes my throat hurt.

### Wisper returns (and immediately insults me)
I called Wisper back.

He looked at me and said “Fuck you” in Celestial.

And I said, “Love you too.”

Because what else do you do when your little piece of home comes back rude and alive?

I pet him like I was trying to remember what warmth is.

Then I realized: flying things “die” here. Or they don’t last. Or something about the air hates wings.

So later, I summoned a black cat instead.

I’m calling him **Voodoo**.

He walked beside me like he belonged there, like he didn’t care that the sky was wrong.

Cats are like that.

---

### The Ethereal check that showed *nothing*
I went Ethereal for a few minutes—properly, with the big spell this time. Once a day, fifteen minutes, and it always feels like stepping half out of your own skin.

Normally there’s *something*.

Echoes. Spirits. Predators. Threads. Old stains. Movement.

But there was nothing.

No death. No watchers. No drifting souls. No structure.

Just… blank.

That’s what scared me most.

Because “nothing” in a place like this is never neutral.  
It’s the pause before something decides to breathe again.

---

### Resting in the hut (the only mercy I trust)
We rested in the hut.

The air inside is always nice. It’s one of the only spells I have that feels like a promise that stays kept.

I took fourth watch.

I changed into pajamas like a small act of rebellion. Like: *I am still allowed softness.*

And I slept.

And I dreamed—

Someone was speaking. Saying something important. The meaning was building, like a knot loosening.

And then they stopped.

Silence swallowed the end of it.

I woke up right before the truth could finish forming.

Which feels… intentional.

### Fell’s End
We crossed another creaking bridge and the fog thinned and the town appeared like it had been waiting to disappoint us.

**Fell’s End**.

It’s not a name. It’s a diagnosis.

Every building looks like it’s giving up.  
Every person looks like they already did.

The Hooked Horn Inn is the center of it—like a heart that never learned how to beat again.

Inside, the air tastes stale and warm and wrong. Purple candle flames that don’t comfort. Patrons hunched like they’re folding into themselves.

And the barkeep—

A satyr. Emerald horns. Tattoos that pulse. Smile too wide. Eyes too bright.

Predator pretending to be hospitality.

He pissed me off *immediately*.

Not even just what he said—though he was rude and smug in a way that made my skin crawl—but the way he looked like a joke that someone told badly, and expected me to clap.

I don’t like him.

I don’t trust him.

And the worst part is: I want his key.

The key he carries like he knows it makes him important.

So now the plan is to come back and take him.

Kidnap him if we have to.

Maybe kill him.

And I am surprised how easy that thought came.

I don’t know what that says about me, but I can feel the Shadowfell trying to sand down my edges until nothing hurts anymore—because nothing matters.

I refuse.

---

### Leo (and the silence that isn’t failure)
I sent Sending to Leo.

I know it worked. It didn’t fail. No backlash, no static, no “your message cannot be delivered.”

So he got it.

And he didn’t answer.

Which is… its own kind of answer.

Or maybe he couldn’t.

Or maybe he’s somewhere that makes replying dangerous.

I keep trying not to imagine the worst.
I keep failing.

---

### The memory I gave away (and took back)
Sebastian reminded me—casually, like it was nothing—that I gave up a key memory to the tree.

As payment.

And I hate that I didn’t even get to *keep* the full shape of what I sacrificed. Like the act of giving it away also stole the outline.

So I used the Crystal of Restored Memory.

And it hurt.

It hurt like ripping a stitch out of skin that never healed properly.

It was a prayer. A real one. Not performance. Not ritual for show.

The kind of prayer you say when you’re too tired to be clever.

And with it came a piece of “normal.”
A piece of me that still believes peace is possible.

For a moment, it grounded me.

And then the fear came back:

If I can give away memory—
If I can lose minutes, lose hours, lose *truth*—

How many of my “certainties” are just stories I keep telling myself because the alternative is unbearable?

I’ve always been told I’m gifted.
A human girl with magic.
Like Leo.
Like it runs in the family like sunlight.

But I’m starting to wonder if that story was just the version of me that made sense to everyone else.

And if it’s a lie, then what am I?

### The halo conversation (and me being “just human”)
At the inn we talked, and somehow we ended up back at the halo again.

Zel said something about me being like him. Or him being like me.

And I said: I’m just a human girl.

Because I need that to be true.

Sebastian—sweet idiot—said something about aasimar halos and how Zel might be “a quarter aasimar.”

He said it gently. Like he was trying to help me not be scared.

But I’ve never met an aasimar with a halo like mine.

And I don’t *have* one.

Except I do.

Except it’s always there when I lose control, or when I decide I’d rather everyone be hurt and alive than dead and untouched.

I hate the halo.

I fear it.

Because it’s proof that the mask is thinner than I want.

And I’m not ready to be something that isn’t human.

Not in a world that already treats “different” like a target.

### The “wizard tower” that looked like a shop
We went looking around and found what looked like a shop.

A normal storefront, normal enough that my brain relaxed for half a heartbeat.

And then it wasn’t normal.

It was a wizard’s tower. Or a warded building. Or something that had teeth.

I went in—because I’m me, apparently—and the wizard came at me like he wanted me dead.

I panicked.

I Astral Stepped to get away.

Then tried gaseous form to leave and couldn’t.

So I broke the form and walked down like I belonged there, because sometimes pretending you’re not terrified is the only armor you have left.

I sent Sebastian a message and told him what happened.

I wanted to stay away from the party after that.

Not because I don’t trust them—(well, not only that)—
but because I don’t trust *me* to stay calm when everything keeps jumping at my throat.

---

### Tonight’s ending (rage as a lantern)
We decided: we’re taking the barkeep’s key.

We went back.

I hit him with two high-powered Magic Missiles right at the door.

And he—of course—poofed away and ran.

Coward.

Fearful butt.

And now the game is paused on that feeling:
my anger buzzing under my skin like a spell that hasn’t decided what shape it wants yet.

I want to go home.

I want a sky that has stars where stars belong.

I want Leo safe.

I want my memories to stop being something I can lose like loose coin.

I want to be “just human” again.

And I don’t know which of those wants is the most impossible.

But tomorrow, I will still wake up and study my spells.

Because even here—

even in the place that tries to make you hollow—

I am not done.
