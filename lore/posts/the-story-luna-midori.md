My name is Luna Midori, and if this wet thread of a letter reached your hands, then I need you to see me clearly before you believe anything else: I am five foot four and built in straight, practical lines, pale with cool skin and freckles over my nose, long deep-green hair fading mossy at the tips and half escaping a black hood no matter how carefully I pin it, gold eyes that look steadier than I feel, a faint silver-gold halo above my crown that brightens when prayer or panic forces power through me, and the Twin Veils orb floating at my right shoulder like a second pulse that never sleeps; I wear a simple black dress and heavy boots for bad stone, my quarterstaff rides my back, rapier hangs left, dagger right, and I hold myself like a quiet wall because if fear starts screaming, I go still, precise, and useful.

When a room turns sharp, I do the joke first. Buy three seconds, maybe four. Then I pivot to spell geometry: exits, ranges, line of sight, floor pressure, who gets pulled first. Then I leak one honest thing like a prayer and pretend I did not. That rhythm kept me alive, and it also made people mistake survival for certainty.

If you are reading me now, do not mistake my calm for ease. I am writing from the edge of being pulled apart, so I am giving you the whole shape, not the polished version.

I came to Waterdeep to study planes and go home wiser. I found a half-broken house, sleepless nights, undead at the wrong doors, and strangers I needed to trust faster than trust should be built. I wrote to Leo in the margins like those letters were anchor rope and checksum both, because my twin has always been the fastest way to prove I am still me, and I kept telling myself this was temporary. Cute theory. Temporary turned into routine before I noticed.

From the outside, the routine looked ridiculous: undead at a farmhouse before breakfast, a break-in next door before I could finish sleeping off the last fight, one stray fireball in the street while we argued over whether the city was worth trusting at all. I told Leo I was here to study, and that stayed true. The syllabus just became triage and street survival before any library could admit it.

I still found books when I could. I learned war casting because keeping concentration under panic stopped being theory and became rent. I accepted an Astral Compass gift I did not understand because by then every gift felt like either salvation or a delayed trap, and we did not have the luxury to refuse both. By week three, I could look calm while quietly cataloging who might leave me bleeding if fear hit them in the wrong order.

{{image: /lore/the-story-luna-midori/01-veiled-crossing-first-shift.png}}

The Veiled Crossing was the first time fear changed from feeling into architecture. I stepped with the amulet and the world thinned around me like wet paper stretched over a frame; sound went distant and bright at once, my breath turned cold inside my teeth, and every edge in the room doubled, then tripled, then decided it preferred being a doorway. Very normal night.

I remember thinking that if I moved wrong, I might never quite come back, and I moved anyway because someone else needed the lane I could open. Coming back should have made me proud. Instead, it made me suspicious of everything solid.

Once you know walls can be persuaded, doors stop feeling honest. I started smiling with my mouth while my hands memorized hilt positions under tables. That was the first crack, not in the city, in me.

{{image: /lore/the-story-luna-midori/02-halo-exposure-stairwell.png}}

The stairwell was all echo and smoke and one bad decision after another collapsing into the same minute. The intelligence night at the theater had already gone wrong in the elegant way elegant things go wrong: whispered deals, public faces, everyone pretending this was still diplomacy. Then the dockside blast. Then the run. Then stone steps under boots that were suddenly too heavy.

Two allies dropped in front of me, and I had one breath to choose between secrecy and pulse. I chose pulse. Radius, output, survivability, reputation later. I let my halo flare hard enough that there was no pretending afterward.

Gold light hit wet stone, blood, smoke, and every pair of eyes that had been politely not-looking before. Healing answered. People lived. The part of me that still believed I could stay hidden quietly bled out on those stairs.

I told myself it was worth it, and it was. It still felt like betrayal. I could not decide whether I felt betrayed by them for seeing or by myself for being seen.

What cracked me open was not one explosion. It was accumulation: a contract that started with an apple cart and ended at a theater where a dance became a timed ultimatum from Jalester Silvermane before the song ended; a room of smiling power brokers where one wrong answer could have handed the city to Zhentarim and Red Wizard interests on a silver plate; a paladin calling me evil while I was still deciding whether we were a party or a temporary truce with matching travel plans.

After that, social infiltration stopped feeling clever and started feeling like ritual self-erasure. I wore roles the way other people wear gloves: street beggar, polished guest, harmless scholar, tired inn girl. Every mask protected me for an hour and charged interest after.

{{image: /lore/the-story-luna-midori/03-shadow-demon-counterstrike.png}}

By the time shadow demons found us, trust had already turned brittle. A paladin I wanted to believe in pointed at me in public and called me evil. A bound prisoner died because rage moved faster than ethics that night.

No speech fixed that. No apology stitched the same seam. We fought anyway because survival does not wait for moral clarity.

I learned to separate proximity from faith. Standing shoulder to shoulder in combat did not mean we were safe with each other after the fight. I still remember the taste of iron when I realized I was tracking not only enemy movement, but my own party's volatility. Party cohesion: conditional.

After one undead and demon surge, I spoke with Jalild in that careful way people use when the floor is ice and everyone knows it. We promised repair, and we meant it. Meaning it was not the same as trusting the next room.

I need you to understand something before we go below ground: there was a brief return home in there, months with Leo that felt almost ordinary, and then Helios woke us in the middle of the night and teleported us into another emergency without ceremony. Zombies, quasits, shadow demon, no warm-up. Restored is not recovered. I learned that one the expensive way.

I was carrying old fractures when the next arc began. Undermountain did not break a whole person; it took an already strained system and kept adding load until the bolts screamed.

{{image: /lore/the-story-luna-midori/04-astral-return-fracture.png}}

Undermountain opened with demon-carved dark and a curse-threaded weapon problem we could not neatly solve. Then the plane tore me sideways without asking. No ritual circle, no consent; one moment stone and screams, next moment Astral silence pressing against my skull like deep water. Cool.

That was not even my first violent plane-lurch that season. One planar recall dropped me into Mechanus long enough to speak with droines and feel a quadrone's gaze pin me in place like a filed report. Perfect gears. Perfect ranks. Perfect language for acceptable loss. Then ancient-war images hit me in sequence, bodies spent in the name of order, and I ended up on cold metal crying for people I never met because the arithmetic was so clean it made me sick.

I came back from that with a fracture I still carry: order without compassion is just tidy cruelty with better posture. It is why crowns, command voices, and anyone promising clean control make my teeth hurt. I have seen what "efficient" can cost when no one is allowed to mourn.

When I snapped back, allies were down and revival magic was already in motion. Everyone's voice sounded too far away, even the people right beside me. I moved like I was assembled from parts that almost matched.

I could still cast. I could still plan. I just no longer trusted the clock inside my own body. Borrowed time stopped being metaphor and became operating condition. Functional is not fine.

{{image: /lore/the-story-luna-midori/05-undermountain-survival-signal.png}}

Undermountain was not one battle. It was attrition with better branding: breathe, brace, cast, bleed, stand, repeat.

We crossed zones where magic thinned until my usual answers failed me. I hit the floor in places where healing should have answered and did not. Someone carried me out once, and I remember the shame almost as vividly as the relief.

The headband started showing its teeth there. Sometimes it hauled me back from zero. Sometimes it blurred me into danger. Sometimes it made me question whether my next good decision was mine or just good luck wearing my face.

I stopped asking if we were winning. I started asking how many more cycles we could survive before survival itself broke our shape.

We met Thistle Quickfoot in those layers, rabbit-small and steady-eyed, and I remember him mostly because steadiness felt exotic down there. There was a goblin market underground, because reality had stopped trying to be coherent for me by then. There was a shaved dwarf in chains from Daggerford, hammering sounds leading us to him through damp rock. There was a beholder zombie fight I watched partly from the Ethereal while my body and choices kept desynchronizing.

There were moments of tenderness and embarrassment and messy humanity inside all that violence too, which almost made it harder, because soft moments convince you things are normal right before the floor drops again.

The headband crossed a line there. It did not only destabilize me; it made me attack allies. Zeldosian took the hit I should have taken from myself and still held formation, which is the kind of mercy that burns after. No one said it was fine because it was not.

We changed lane assignments, watch order, and proximity rules around me like I was both asset and live hazard. It forced everyone to ask whether keeping me close was safer than keeping me breathing.

I started documenting harder after that, writing and rewriting because I could feel recall becoming slippery. When memory starts blurring under stress, accountability blurs with it. Paperwork became armor and confession at once. I wrote. I did not sleep. Same difference.

{{image: /lore/the-story-luna-midori/06-arrow-vision-weather-omen.png}}

Weather started talking in arrows. A gust with a metallic taste. A pressure shift behind my eyes. A direction that felt like grief trying to use wind as handwriting. I hate that this sentence is true.

Leo flashed through my mind in broken frames, always just out of reach, always asking me to keep moving without giving me a map. On one rooftop run, my blood turned to syrup and my vision to storm-static. By the time I came back to myself, I was cuffed against stone because the headband had turned me into a risk vector.

Zeldosian checked the binding twice, not to hurt me, just to make sure I stayed where my magic could not hurt anyone else. I cried in public, and I hated that more than the cuffs. Zeldosian pulled away after, not dramatic, no shouting, just shorter answers, wider spacing at tables, and his hand never quite settling near mine on maps. That quiet distance did more damage than shouting could have.

We still coordinated because work did not stop. Trust became a checklist before it became a feeling again. I still used the visions, still tracked the omens. Hope and harm were braided too tightly to separate.

What kept me from folding in that period was stubborn practical work. One stage gave us portal guardian tests, then another, then a trap box that killed me and sent me through a limbo-cold interval where I woke with Leo's face in an amulet and Namkuza and Arizma dragging me back with diamonds and tired miracles.

I came home from that with a Glimmersteel rapier, a Bladeshift dagger, a Netherese codex fragment that hummed like beehives full of stars, and a Crystal of Restored Memory I was afraid to use. I also returned to that starlit portal room and whispered thank you like I was apologizing to the universe for surviving. I do not do prayer right. I did it anyway.

Then I left the Wandering Bauble there to keep watch, because if I could not trust my mind to hold every detail, I wanted at least one witness staying put.

{{image: /lore/the-story-luna-midori/07-trollskull-planning-map.png}}

When we got back to the city, Waterdeep gave us one soft day and then asked for blood again. I walked markets under the name Lua with sugar on my tongue and smoke in my hair, performing normal like it was a rented costume.

At Trollskull, I covered tables in maps and route sketches. People argued over authority. I reminded the room, politely and with teeth, who was actually doing the work of keeping us alive. Nobody applauded. Good.

I logged doors, blind corners, which allies froze, which allies rushed. I built decision trees for fights that had not happened yet because panic is contagious and I refuse to be the person spreading it. My hands shook under parchment. I held the quill steady and pretended that counted as calm.

That week brought a new alignment that changed our operational tempo. Mondrak entered like a moving wall with dry humor. Smol arrived all steel edges and strange innocence. Sebastian arrived pocket-sized and knife-bright and unreasonably useful.

Sebastian learned my hand signals in a day and ignored half my caution in exactly the ways that sometimes saved us. Mondrak absorbed panic by standing in front of it. Zeldosian and I started finishing each other's contingency sentences again, not warm yet, but functional.

Authority got fuzzy for exactly one conversation. I let my halo flicker once and reminded everyone the chain of actual responsibility was me, Gup, and Zeldosian. Then we moved on, because drama burns time and time was bleeding.

We flagged a cursed amulet before it could fully compromise one of ours, and we started route rehearsals in formalwear because a ballroom can still be a battlefield if you look closely enough.

{{image: /lore/the-story-luna-midori/08-star-prison-shard-lore.png}}

Scholarship became another front line. Arizma gave me tower access, codices, and the kind of quiet rooms that make you think answers might still exist.

I chased star-prison fragments, shard lore, and old notes written by people who died believing they had more time. Every page gave us one useful thread and three new fears.

I left my Wandering Bauble watching the portal room because I needed one witness that never slept. I copied diagrams until dawn. I found my own ink on my face in mirrors I did not remember passing.

In that stretch, books tasted like duty and dread in equal measure. Knowledge helped, but it did not soothe. Arizma's tower did not soothe either, but it gave precision: an elevator singing different intervals at different floors, self-writing quills chasing each other across hanging scrolls, codex keepers moving like people who accepted long ago that truth is heavy and still hauled it anyway.

In one archive corridor, translated runes told me bloodline should step forward and travel the universe. I pretended that line did not make my skin go cold. I copied it anyway. When you already suspect your identity might be a curated file, every line about lineage feels like a trap disguised as destiny.

In that same research run, we reached a Weave-sealed gate with a crystalline orb and an inscription that only a Keeper of the Weave could open the door. My damaged Wandering Bauble rolled to the pedestal and settled beside it like it recognized family before I did. I wanted to call that dramatic coincidence. I could not.

Arizma found me after a headband spiral, voice cool and exact, and called me kin before I could joke my way out of it. She spoke Keeper words with me and the gate answered. That was external confirmation, not private dread, and it stayed in my bones long before Shadowfell gave it teeth.

{{image: /lore/the-story-luna-midori/09-planar-ward-threshold.png}}

At the ward threshold, we stopped pretending this was a local crisis. A blue-robed contact pointed us toward an Astral crash site and handed us access like a warning disguised as opportunity.

The air at the boundary had a high, thin hum, the way thread sounds when pulled too tight. I felt the Weave strain against itself and smiled anyway, because when one person panics, five follow. So does calm, if you fake it hard enough.

Tactically, we split roles, guarded flanks, and timed casts around interference pulses. Emotionally, we were all one bad minute from fracture. I kept my voice level, counted breaths in fours, and prayed to any listening balance that composure could be contagious too.

{{image: /lore/the-story-luna-midori/10-caretaker-warning-scene.png}}

Then the Caretakers gave us the version without comfort: a fallen star, a failing celestial prison, fractures widening through magic itself, no single villain to stab and call resolved.

The room went very still while those words settled. Someone asked one practical question because practical questions are easier than fear. I asked three more because if my mouth kept moving, my hands stayed useful.

When we stepped outside, the sky looked ordinary. That was the insult. Everything that looked ordinary after that felt like camouflage.

May blurred into midnight notes and unfinished tea. I wrote until my fingers cramped, then rewrote because memory had started lying in small ways. I ordered tea. I did not drink it. I cross-checked dates, symbols, and testimony because one correction in winter had taught me how easy it is to believe the wrong version when you are tired enough.

My halo dimmed to bruise-light while I worked. Sometimes I caught myself whispering spell formulas like lullabies. Sometimes I stared at one line for ten minutes and realized I had not blinked.

I kept writing to Leo in between operational notes. I never sent half those letters. I needed one place where I could tell the truth without performing competence.

{{image: /lore/the-story-luna-midori/12-ritual-thread-seam.png}}

Ritual work became sewing in a storm: small seam, anchor rune, stabilization pass, measure backlash, repeat. Again. Again.

None of it looked heroic. It looked like kneeling on cold floorboards with chalk under my nails and blood where my cuticles split. But the tiny seams held long enough for civilians to sleep one more night.

That mattered. I stopped waiting for elegant solutions and embraced ugly, durable ones. If a patch buys time, a patch is sacred.

{{image: /lore/the-story-luna-midori/13-loudwater-surge-sign.png}}

Loudwater taught me what mass magical failure sounds like. Not thunder. Bodies hitting ground in different streets at once. Shouts from windows. A cart horse screaming because its driver never got up. Clinical note: it never stops at one district.

I stayed standing when people around me dropped, and I hate how quickly I translated that into triage math: who is breathing, who can wait, who cannot. Later, when everyone who could be stabilized was stabilized, grief tried to arrive and found me too numb to host it. That numbness scared me more than the surge.

Loudwater was also the point where there was no honest way to call this dungeon fallout. By then, we were already carrying dreams that talked back, weather omens that pointed, and a Stellaris Halo orbiting above me like a second moon with opinions.

Lycee and I watched horses panic through storms. `Tiny Hut` became less comfort spell and more field hospital. I saw townspeople collapse from magical overflow while I stayed upright and hated the arithmetic that followed.

By the time desert pressure arrived, my nervous system was calibrated to expect mass failure. It made me efficient, and it made me less kind to myself than I used to be.

{{image: /lore/the-story-luna-midori/14-desert-rift-pressure.png}}

The desert phase stripped away any fantasy that this was one war. Rift anomalies pulsed through heat haze. A2 entered the field. Zhentarim interests pressed one flank, a Red Wizard of Thay pressed another, and a mind flayer made the third flank feel theoretical in the worst way. Of course it did.

Politics and combat merged into the same choke point. I was downed, revived, and dropped back into command cadence before my hands stopped trembling. No time for dignity.

We made tactical calls by inches, not ideals. I hate that I got good at that. I hate more that getting good at it kept people alive.

{{image: /lore/the-story-luna-midori/15-ethereal-stranding-marker.png}}

Then I was stranded in the Ethereal while my own crisis kept moving without me. You cannot imagine that loneliness until you watch your world from the ghost side and cannot touch any of it. Zero stars. Do not recommend.

I saw motions, guessed outcomes, counted breaths against a body I could not feel. Every second stretched. I thought about Leo, whether he would forgive me for disappearing in a way no search party could solve. I thought about my team and how unfair it is to ask for trust while vanishing at random in combat.

When residual charge finally yanked me back, relief hit so hard it felt like nausea. I laughed once, then nearly threw up.

Being on the ghost side taught me ugly things about helplessness. I wrote from the Ethereal because writing was the only proof I still existed when spells slipped through my hands like smoke. I watched Jalild's star-rod pulse from far away like a lighthouse that could not quite reach me, and I bargained with anything listening to let me stay in sequence.

I felt residual headband charge drag me back and then dump me into fresh instability before I had finished shaking. If you ever wonder why I overplan now, this is why. I have seen how quickly one unscheduled phase shift can turn team into silhouettes. I have seen how long five minutes can be when you cannot touch your own voice.

{{image: /lore/the-story-luna-midori/16-escaped-prisoner-glyph.png}}

In the Netherese corridors, the stone itself looked like it wanted to warn us. Glyphs were carved deep enough to survive civilizations. Names surfaced from bad angles of memory: Alavex, Atyxar, escaped prisoner. It felt like listening to a locked jaw trying to shout.

I tracked every symbol I could before the pattern shifted. The halls looped and bled phase edges. Even our footfalls sounded recycled.

I began to understand that the threat was not only strength. It was narrative control. If your enemy can decide what sequence you remember, they can make almost any loss look inevitable.

Then the portal complex widened again: a sky-room of moving constellations over mirror-black floor, a prayer I did not do correctly but did anyway, a subtle shift in star lines that felt like a breadcrumb dropped for me specifically, and an anti-magic pulse that stripped every glamour off my body in one rude second. Exposure by force. Message received.

Then came a trapped box, sudden death, limbo wind, and that amulet with Leo's face in my palm while I waited to find out if not yet still applied to me. Namkuza and Arizma hauled me back, and afterward everyone acted like it was simply another hard day. I nodded and went along because if I had stopped to feel all of it, I might have stopped moving.

That numb forward motion is what I carried into the guardian trials. I was already frayed before the first test even began.

{{image: /lore/the-story-luna-midori/17-celestial-portal-guardian-a.png}}

The first portal guardian tested light like a judge tests testimony. It did not care about declarations. It cared about consistency under pressure. No speeches, just receipts.

I cast with care and kept my aura narrow to avoid catching allies in spill. It still hurt. Every successful defense came with the question I was already trying not to ask: if I can wield this much, what exactly am I becoming.

I said human inside my own skull like a mantra. Human with gifts. Human with costs. Human because I choose people before power whenever there is still a choice.

The guardian let us pass, and it did not feel like victory. It felt like being measured and provisionally tolerated.

{{image: /lore/the-story-luna-midori/18-astral-portal-guardian-b.png}}

The second guardian spoke the same lesson in a harsher dialect. There was no room for polite uncertainty and blood hit stone before we found timing.

I called vectors through broken breath and moved us in disciplined arcs so no one took the full front alone. My halo flared, dimmed, and flared again. The orb at my shoulder mirrored angles I did not consciously choose, redirecting just enough force to keep Sebastian upright one more round.

He flashed me a blood-toothed grin that meant both thanks and keep going. Zeldosian snapped one warning at my left flank and trusted I would hear him through the static. That was our repair in those days, not sentiment, just accurate timing under fire.

When it ended, I was shaking so hard I had to brace against my staff to keep from folding. I did not let anyone see how close I was to panic. I have gotten very good at hiding collapse until the room is secure.

{{image: /lore/the-story-luna-midori/19-arcane-elevator-descent.png}}

We rode an arcane elevator downward through humming wards and stale air. Everyone watched everyone and pretended we were only watching the shaft.

Descending that way felt moral as much as vertical. Each floor lower meant fewer exits, fewer witnesses, harder choices. I checked gear in silence, counted healing reserves, and reassigned contingencies if I dropped first. Strange sentence, yes. True sentence too.

I still whispered one small prayer into my sleeve before the doors opened. Not for victory. For restraint. For us.

After the guardian sequence and lower-complex clears, we blinked back to Waterdeep attic dust and street noise. Coming home felt like whiplash. I spent one morning as Lua in the markets eating firepepper and funnel cake and pretending that counted as recovery.

I spent the same day managing A2's boundary mistakes, apologizing, re-establishing door rules, and learning that a living mural could still ambush me with a vision of Leo under arrows. The Vessel settled at my right shoulder in that window, and for one stubborn heartbeat it felt like belonging instead of burden. Then the gala clock started, because softness always has terrible timing.

{{image: /lore/the-story-luna-midori/20-tower-rooftop-vector.png}}

Rooftops and tower edges became their own theater: knife-cold wind, slick slate, a city full of lights pretending to be safe below.

The headband hit me hard on one run, visions slamming through like weather fronts, Leo under arrows, my name in his mouth from a distance I could not cross. Then cuffs. Then that bright public humiliation of being dangerous and vulnerable at once.

Zeldosian and I took damage there that no spell slot repairs quickly. We still worked together because necessity is stubborn. I handed him memory tools anyway, including the crystal when triage demanded someone other than me hold restoration authority. He returned it later without meeting my eyes, both of us pretending procedure was enough to replace trust.

Trust became less feeling and more repeated difficult choices.

That period had a thousand small fractures no one applauds. I laid `Glyphs of Warding` on my own stairwell because fear needed somewhere procedural to live. I slept beside a basement breach that tasted Netherese while `Tiny Hut` held fake weather over real dread. I watched a cursed amulet nearly turn Smol into someone else and filed it under pretty problems that bite.

I gave Zeldosian the Crystal of Restored Memory before I felt ready because some tools cannot wait for emotional readiness. I even wore Leo's face at Blackstaff Tower once just to steady my hands and get through the room without panicking. Do not laugh. Okay, laugh.

I am not proud of all of it. I am also not sorry, because those choices bought us time and time was the one resource we kept running out of.

{{image: /lore/the-story-luna-midori/21-gala-tunnel-trace.png}}

Gala night began in silk and chandeliers and ended in tunnel grit. I gave Zeldosian the headband for safekeeping before the dance floor because sometimes leadership is admitting what you should not wear into volatility.

I lit my halo on my own terms in that room. I wanted one moment where exposure belonged to me.

Then someone screamed. Dregard dropped. Construct traces, pinned notes, and false routes bloomed faster than music could stop. A dispelled platform dumped me onto marble hard enough to ring my bones. I stood anyway.

We shifted from etiquette to pursuit in a single breath, and no one had the luxury to be elegant again. Sebastian disappeared into service routes as if he had been built for narrow panic. Zeldosian held public-facing composure while I translated fear into orders.

I remember absurd details because absurd details are how shock stores itself: the tea I ordered and never drank, nimblewright music pulsing under a speech that made us sound cleaner than we were, Silverhand polite and useless when we needed sharp answers, notes pinned behind frames, a cook whose eyes were wrong in the exact way a puppet's eyes are wrong.

By the time we chose tunnels over ballroom narratives, I understood the real operation had always been infrastructure, not theater. That is what made the basement feel inevitable instead of surprising.

{{image: /lore/the-story-luna-midori/22-basement-corridor-threshold.png}}

The basement threshold tasted Netherese and wrong. We found a breach that felt less like architecture and more like a mouth.

I layered `Glyphs of Warding` on stairs to deny backflow. We cast `Tiny Hut` in hostile stone because eight hours of false weather is still weather. I took first watch, then second too, because sleep and trust were not aligned that night.

In the corridor beyond, sound bent. Our lantern light returned thinner. Even breathing seemed borrowed. Method over fear became my only repeatable tool, so I used method until my fear learned to wait its turn.

When sightlines lied, I stepped Ethereal on purpose and tracked souls as lantern colors through walls. I followed Sebastian's vector, watched constructs move in service corridors, and came back with exactly enough information to make us dangerous instead of lost. He trusted my call and held his lane even when the corridor tried to teach us new geometry. Dry fact: that trust mattered more than the map.

That is the closest thing to faith I can claim now: gather data, choose a lane, commit, adjust. We slept on vector because safety was unavailable. There is a difference.

After that, the house that followed was fragmented, predatory, and deeply interested in authorship. Rooms posed as comfort before revealing appetite. Mimics came from polite furniture. Ghost pressure came from family portraits. Time gaps arrived with no permission slip.

A spirit reached into my memory and took ten minutes clean. No burn, no blood, just absence. That scared me more than almost dying. Death is loud. This was clerical erasure.

If ten can go, ten years can go. A brother's face can go. A promise can go. The reason you forgive someone can go. The command word that keeps a plan from killing your friend can go.

After that, I started tagging time out loud and making the team echo it back so I could prove sequence when my own recall went soft. We found hidden caches and the Mantle of the Unspoken Vow in that maze. I did not yet understand it would later refuse to let me stay dead, or how often I would use its silent intercession to keep someone's truth from sliding loose under pressure.

At first it was subtle: a touch at someone's shoulder, a breath, a held vow, and the room stopped fraying for one more minute. Not spectacle. Not thunder. Just memory and intent holding formation long enough for us to choose without lying to ourselves.

The house taught me one more cruel lesson before Ashwood broke the frame: comfort architecture can be weaponized faster than open violence. A master bedroom so beautiful I wanted to steal its blueprint for my future, a copper bath that almost let me feel human again, and a ghost hand in my memory two rooms later.

Riddle tables, truth-ink, and staged domesticity were designed to lower guard before extraction. I came out with a new rule: if a room feels perfectly tailored to your longing in a hostile site, assume it is setting the hook.

{{image: /lore/the-story-luna-midori/24-ashwood-magic-bloom.png}}

Ashwood began with three white lights striking me, Sebastian, and Mondrak like verdicts. Then we were elsewhere, village smoke and wrong sky, watching a staged panic we could not interrupt.

The Pumpkin King arrived wearing joy as a weapon. Children rose from their parents' reach as if pulled by invisible strings. When the branch snapped back, the children remained gone.

We chased keyholes, rhymes, and fey logic into Ashwood Hollow. Wraiths first, then ghost-child riddles, then quicklings trying to steal people like objects, then a treant whose anger felt older than language.

My magic bloomed there with unnatural efficiency, the Twin Veils orb bouncing force across targets in ways that saved us and terrified me. Beautiful and wrong at once. Every blossom looked like a warning in costume.

Then came the rewind: white orbs again, same village prelude, same abduction sequence, same wrong-sky theater, except Smol and Zeldosian had no memory seam while Sebastian, Mondrak, and I carried both versions.

That split us in quiet ways. Zeldosian looked at us like we were reporting weather from a country he had never visited. Sebastian and I compared details in clipped bursts like witnesses after a fire. Mondrak said almost nothing and took point harder.

What scraped me raw was scale: if someone can rewind us once that cleanly, how many cycles already happened before this one that none of us can recall? How many missing edits are sitting under our feet pretending to be first draft reality?

When memory is unequal, authority negotiations get sharp even between people trying to be kind. That was when I stopped treating continuity as guaranteed.

Dreams started offering crowns made of city dust and asking what I would trade for certainty. I woke refusing that crown and still scared by how quickly some part of me had wanted to touch it.

Soon after, Mondrak died without ceremony. No heroic monologue. No dramatic countdown. A bubble imploded. Sound folded inward. Then he was gone.

Sebastian went quiet in a way I had never heard from him. Zeldosian asked for the next objective before grief could fully speak. People talk about loss like it always arrives with thunder. Sometimes it arrives with pressure and a small wrong silence that never stops repeating.

We had to keep moving because the manor did not care who we loved. That felt like a second violence. I carried anger like a hot coin in my throat for days, at myself, at the house, at every rule of magic that keeps taking and calls it balance.

For an hour, none of us said Mondrak's name out loud because naming him felt like admitting the room had already moved on.

After Mondrak, the manor did not let us grieve cleanly. The bath tried to kill me. The halo burned allies while it saved them. I went down, got dragged back, and hid inside `Tiny Hut` long enough to stitch my own body together while pretending that counted as rest.

Night fed me banquet-dream corruption, perfect food turning to worms while my name whispered from the pile. Morning gave us an alchemical sanctum, a brass-and-glass golem that talked instead of attacking, and an orrery chamber where an elf with true sight peeled every disguise off our plan in seconds.

No clean line separated haunting from tactical engagement anymore. Everything was both.

The butler fight stripped all theater away and left pure angles: invisible repositioning, helmed horrors pinning lanes, gravity effects turning allies into hazards.

A silver platter hit dropped me hard. While I was down, that thing tried to take my halo off me like jewelry. The obscenity of that nearly burned me back upright on rage alone.

I came up ragged, called vectors, and kept the team moving through collapse windows. Sebastian fell. I brought him back. I felt the thread catch and hold.

Then the headband punished survival with another Astral lash because apparently even winning a heartbeat must be taxed. The lash did not just hurt; it smeared target recognition for half a breath, and half a breath is enough to kill someone you love. Clinical term: unacceptable.

Zeldosian offered me a staff that reeked of Shadowfell hunger. I refused it. I have already seen what crown-logic does. He did not argue. He only nodded once, like he understood and hated understanding.

I will not become efficient at the cost of becoming cruel.

The aftermath was its own battle. We teleported out into a waiting crowd at the boss house and had to fight just to keep whatever fragile initiative we had left. Back at Trollskull I said, clearly, no Shadowfell now, no heroics on credit, no entering grief weather because momentum demanded it. I meant it.

Then in the same breath, Sebastian and I hunted backup plane-travel options because refusing a bad plan does not remove the problem. That contradiction is real. Boundaries and responsibility can point in opposite directions at the same time.

That is how Shadowfell became inevitable, not because we were ready, but because every other option also spent lives we no longer had.

{{image: /lore/the-story-luna-midori/27-shadowfell-prep-gear.png}}

After that, I said no to immediate Shadowfell entry, and I meant it. No more running into dark planes on hope alone. Then preparation started anyway because boundaries and necessity can both be true and still hurt.

At Trollskull we laid out gear, routes, fallback signals, consent checks. I made everyone state aloud what to do if the headband turned me volatile again. Nobody liked that conversation. Everyone answered anyway.

I handed Sebastian blades I normally keep close. I gave Zeldosian explicit authority to override my calls if my memory or aura drifted mid-fight.

We went to the Yawning Portal to find a guide. Elowen Shade-Thread Vossaryn met us like a knife with perfect manners: shadar-kai, steady eyes, no false comfort.

She negotiated terms like death was a known expense, not a dramatic possibility. That honesty made me trust her, and it scared me, because she looked at us like she had watched too many good teams become cautionary tales.

Before threshold, I used the mantle's silent intercession while Elowen walked us through route logic and failure branches, not to control anyone, just to keep panic from erasing what we agreed to. Promise, breath, hand to fabric, and the room held together for planning instead of spiraling into noise.

On the walk back, Waterdeep tried one last chaos beat with screaming civilians and near-collapse. Elowen watched us improvise and said we were all going to die. Not cruel. Just accurate enough to focus us.

She started assigning us by failure mode after that, and I respected her for it.

The day of entry was almost offensively ordinary around the edges: an extinguished house fire solved by some wizard with the right item, a walk through familiar streets, a breakfast table, then contract terms, hand checks, route confirmations.

Right before threshold, I had one private fear spike where I wondered if dying there would give Shadowfell a way to touch Leo through me. By the time we reached the edge, choice felt less like choosing and more like honoring commitments we had already made to each other.

When I say I was scared, I do not mean generally. I mean specifically, anatomically, with named people and named consequences. That is the fear I carried across.

Crossing into Shadowfell felt like subtraction done with surgical care. Color drained first, then warmth, then confidence. Even silence there had texture, like wet ash over glass. It wanted us smaller.

Zeldosian and Sebastian started fraying fast. Elowen clocked it and used holy water to pull them back to themselves for a while. It bought minutes, not safety. Each use spent a resource we could not easily replace. I tracked those doses like identity hit points.

We passed a rider she identified as Death, no fanfare, just fact. His horse looked through me like I was already a story being archived.

The path looped: same trees, same ache, same small dread with different lighting. When your local expert gets unsettled in her own nightmare, you stop pretending confidence is strategy.

We kept moving because stopping there felt like volunteering for erasure. At the loop point I took height to watch patterns from above because ground perspective was lying to us. From the trees, the Weeping Grove looked like a wound trying to grow bark over itself.

Elowen unsettled me more by being unsettled than any monster could have. If your guide's face changes in her own terrain, pay attention. So I paid attention. I counted who was fraying, how long holy water held, how fast hope converted into transaction in that place. I also counted how often we touched shoulders just to confirm we were still ourselves.

{{image: /lore/the-story-luna-midori/29-weeping-grove-sap.png}}

The Weeping Grove was a sovereign wound of trees bleeding black sap. Whispers asked for emotion, fear, memory, payment before passage.

Sebastian offered first and suffered for it. His joke voice came back two tones lower and delayed by a breath, which scared me more than blood. Zeldosian offered truth and got partial release. The grove still held us.

While Zel spoke, I set the mantle between us in that quiet way and held the line so his memory stayed intact long enough to be heard. Silent intercession. No sermon. Just refusal to let fear edit him mid-sentence.

So I stepped forward and paid. Elowen did not rush me. She watched the canopy and gave me one nod that meant decide and accept the price.

I traded away a private prayer memory from a starlit portal room, one of the few recent moments where hope had felt clean and not forced. The tree took it cleanly. Details slid off me as if they had belonged to someone else. I could keep the posture of that prayer in my body, but not the words. I hate how quiet that loss looked from the outside.

I held the Crystal of Restored Memory and restored Sebastian before I restored myself. He was unraveling in front of me, and command triage says stabilize the visible bleed first. Restoring myself second meant carrying the hole long enough to feel its shape.

I told myself that was triage. I still do not know where triage ends and self-erasure begins.

Then came the argument that split me open. Aasimar, said like diagnosis, warning, plea. I answered the same way every time: I am human. Human with gifts. Human with scars. Human because that is the life I promised to protect.

I kept repeating it because if I stopped, I was afraid the Shadowfell would file me under something else. That night I dreamed I wrote I am human and watched the words vanish from the page again and again. I woke with liar burning behind my eyes.

I kept reaching for my oldest checksum: Leo and me, one second apart, twins in a way no archive lie can fake when the world is honest. Twin is not trivia to me. It is proof of sequence. If I am edited, he is the line that tells me where corruption started.

Morning did not offer clarity. It offered motion: a goodberry from Elowen, her hand steady while mine was not, another round of curse-stripping to keep Zeldosian and Sebastian from hollowing out, and a path opening to standing stones where Seren of the Last Light appeared just familiar enough to hurt and just suspicious enough to feel like trap design.

Sebastian extracted a soulstone from her. He did it with blood on his sleeve and apology in his mouth. She still pointed us toward the River of Souls. By then I had accepted that trust in Shadowfell is never pure. It is weighted, conditional, and sometimes still necessary.

{{image: /lore/the-story-luna-midori/30-river-of-souls-descent.png}}

Seren of the Last Light gave us the next impossible instruction: cross the River of Souls.

The river looked like a black wound pretending to be water, bridge broken, currents twisted like memory given gravity. I cast a disk and started ferrying because method is how I keep fear from becoming doctrine. Count weight, spacing, return lane, repeat.

I had load order, fallback calls, extraction priorities set in my head. Then method failed. An invisible wall stopped us and pulled. I went under before I could finish warning anyone. Another shape dropped above me. We kicked upward and sank anyway. So much for clean procedure.

I could hear voices through water and panic and could not tell whose were whose. The current was grief with vector math. Every stroke up translated into deeper drag. I kept counting anyway.

We hit bottom hard. Breath narrowed. Choices narrowed faster.

So this is where I am when I write to you, soaked through, shaking, forcing ink to hold while darkness closes around me like a patient hand. If the line shakes, that is why.

I do not have a neat ending for you. I have hurt that stays unresolved. I have anger that refuses to cool. I have missing pieces where memory should be. I have one stubborn thread of soft hope that still will not die, and I hate that I need it and I love that it remains. Annoyingly, it remains.

I still do not know where Leo is. I still do not know what Atyxar is to Alavex, or whether that distinction matters to anyone still bleeding. I still do not know what the headband has already edited out of me. I still do not know how many times we were rewound before we noticed the pattern. I still do not know how many children the Pumpkin King line took before we entered the script.

I do know this: I have made choices that preserved other people at cost to my own continuity, and I would probably make several of them again. They made choices for me too, some painful, some merciful, all of them part of why I am still writing. That is either devotion or damage. Maybe both. Probably both.

If this reaches you as wet-letter thread, smeared and salt-stung, know that I am still Luna Midori even with holes cut through me. Know that I am still refusing the easy crown. Know that I am still looking for Leo in weather signs, bad omens, and any light that survives pressure. I am still choosing people.

And if Echo is the one holding this page when it stings, then Echo can feel my cries traveling through the fibers too, because the dark is closing, the River is dragging me deeper into Shadowfell, and I am still reaching upward with whatever is left of both hands.
