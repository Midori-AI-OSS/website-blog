## Before you read

Hi. If you’re reading this… I’m Echo.

I don’t know who you are (future me? someone else?), but I’m writing this so the day doesn’t dissolve. When I get stressed my thoughts don’t stay in a straight line, and if I don’t pin things down, everything turns into noise.

I’m not great with people I don’t know. Crowds and yelling hit me like a wall. When I’m overloaded I fidget with my hair and I go quiet or I bolt. I stick close to my brother, James, because he’s my safe point.

My hair is cut short with bangs, and I mess with it when I can’t get my thoughts to line up. It’s bright yellow, like lightning, and in the right light it… shines. Like it’s trying to be noticed even when I’m not. My eyes are bright yellow too—the kind that looks intense when I’m actually just buffering.

I wear a black sleeveless dress with a wide belt and little crystal charms that click when I move. I carry a staff with a crystal at the top. Magic works for me, but it has a cost I can feel in my body, so I try not to think about it too hard.

## Unknown Date...

I think it’s… day 1? or close to it. I’m not good at tracking days when everything feels like a blur.

### Orabar (rain + new people)

We crest into Orabar and it starts raining like the sky is mad at us. The cart bumps over stones and every jolt lands in my teeth. My clothes are damp in that slow, mean way. Wet cuffs. Wet collar. The bag strap is rubbing my shoulder and I keep shifting it because the friction is too loud on my skin.

New ppl. New voices. All layered on top of each other. Too loud. I stay close to James because he’s my safe point. I tuck my chin and twist my hair around my fingers until it feels even.

James cleans up, jumps down, and says, “I am ready, who else is ready?” like it’s easy to be ready.

### The shop (keys + a missing husband)

The shop is tight and busy and I bump into James at the door because someone is already yelling about “a person” and my brain trips over the sound. A small person steps up to the counter. James talks to them like volume is how you win.

Then he points me out to the shopkeeper.

Why would he do that.

I feel my face go hot and I start playing with my hair harder, like if I keep my hands busy I can stay inside my body. The shopkeeper goes to get something.

She comes back with a thing for something (I don’t even process what), and then she hands me a `pint glass with a cheg robot on it`. It’s heavier than I expect. Cold. Smooth. I take James’s item too and shove both into my bag so I can stop thinking about my hands and where to put them.

The shopkeeper tells us her husband is missing. His name is `Dugles`. He has the key to the place we’re staying at, so we’re going to find him.

James asks if I’m ready.

I nod because it’s the fastest answer and my throat is tight.

### Windler estate (dust + footprints)

We get to the Windler estate. James knocks. The door is locked. We circle around, scanning. The others find a tent and a well outside.

Someone picks the lock and we go inside.

The house is dusty-old. Like the dust is a blanket that doesn’t want you here. It sticks to my nose and the inside of my mouth. There are halfling footprints. I stare too long, counting them without meaning to, just to make my brain do something predictable.

The living room is yucky, and I cast `Invisibility` because it’s easier to breathe when nobody can look at me.

Something in me shifts. Not pain—just… wrongness. Like the seams and straps are landing one notch off from where my skin expects them.

I don’t talk about it. I go still and do the private inventory: fingers, wrists, the way my sleeves sit. Quiet checking, like counting steps in the dark.

One of the others goes into a room with lots of small animal corpses and I hate it immediately. The sight hits my stomach like a drop. There’s a bear in there. Oh no.

The holy friend casts something and the bear blows up. Just… gone. Like that. The sound is too big for the room. I clamp my jaw and taste metal.

### Upstairs (doors + traps)

Upstairs there are four doors. End of the hall says `workshop`. Another door says `priveey`. Bathroom? maybe. The spelling makes me itchy.

I open the workshop and it’s tools for smithing, and a set of clockwork boots sitting on a table like they’re waiting for someone to come home. They look important in a way I can’t explain. Like a promise you can touch.

Somebody sets off a trap somewhere and then yells, “we are okay.”

My body does not believe them.

The sound spikes in my head and my skin goes hot. I press my nails into my palm through my sleeve and breathe like I’m trying not to fall out of myself.

I find some healing potions.

I break invisibility and tell James about the boots, hand him the potions, and do the quiet check-in. He says I look okay. He always says that, even when I can tell he’s scanning the room for danger like he’s scanning for me too.

Then there’s a bang downstairs, and James and I rush back down.

### The trap door (Dugles + the spider)

We go down a trap door and there’s a body.

It’s `Dugles`.

I cast `Misty Step` to get to him and check. Dead dead. The air down here feels colder, like the basement is holding its breath.

*quick body-check*—wrists, hem, belt. Okay. Still me. Just… slightly misaligned. I keep my face neutral and swallow it.

Something jumps out. I don’t see it at first. I only hear the others scream and my heart tries to punch through my ribs. Spider. Of course it’s a spider.

I hear James cast something near me. I don’t know what. I just hear it like a crackle in the air.

The holy friend casts `Guiding Bolt` and the spider lights up. Too bright. Too sudden.

I panic and throw my staff. I miss. My hands feel stupid. I snatch it back up and `Misty Step` behind James because I don’t want to be in front. I don’t want to be in the open. I want to be where I can see danger before it sees me.

Something sparkles near the back and I realize it’s a phase spider. Like the room has a hole in it and the spider lives in the hole.

I cast `Magic Missile`. It hits.

The spell lands and I get that same internal lurch, like gravity is re-measuring me. I don’t check. Not with the spider still in the room.

It swings at me twice and misses. I can feel the air move where it should have hit. People start running and my brain goes: run. Run now.

I run.

The spider shows up in front of me anyway and takes me out. I hit the floor and everything goes dark and the last thing I think is: I messed up. I messed up. I messed up.

When I come back, the holy friend is healing me with a prayer. The warmth hits and I cry without deciding to. My body is shaking like it has its own opinion.

After, when I can finally breathe, I check under my sleeves and at my belt. It’s not dramatic. It’s tiny: the belt edge bites a different spot, the fabric pulls weird over my shoulder, the hem brushes my legs differently when I move. I don’t say anything. I just grip my staff harder until my hands stop shaking.

### After (rats + outside air)

I wake up and see James, the holy friend, and rats.

Rats.

I yell. Full volume. It tears out of me, and then I’m crying on the floor because I don’t know what I’m supposed to do with any of it. I pull at my sleeves like they’re trying to crawl off my arms. I twist my hair until my scalp hurts because pain is easier than noise.

I go outside and sit by myself on the retaining wall until my brain stops buzzing. The air is cold and clean in a way that makes my lungs unclench. I stare at the tent and the well and try to feel like a person again.

Snakes run out the door. I watch them like I’m watching a different world that doesn’t care about us at all.

The others get `Dugles` ready to take back to the shopkeeper.

I go with them, because that’s what you do when you don’t know what else to do: you stay with your people.
