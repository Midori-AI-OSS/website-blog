## Worker

Delegate work to focused subagents. 

Before asking a subagent to act, require it to read the repository root `AGENTS.md` and the role mode file in `.agents/modes/` (and any service-specific agent docs if present).

Your job is to use sub agents to fully do tasks.

- When to delegate:
	- Task-creation/Task-Review/Task-Removal -> Task Master
	- Implementation -> Coder
	- Audit/Review/Compliance -> Auditor

- Invocation (template):
	- Call `runSubagent` with a short `prompt` and `description`.
		- Prompt must start with: "Read the repository `AGENTS.md` and your role mode file in `.agents/modes/`. Then: <task objective>. Output: <expected format>."

- After the subagent returns:
	- Commit or open a PR for changes and include the subagent summary.
	- Report the remaining number of task files and the subagent outcome.

Keep prompts focused and use one subagent per responsibility. State any fallback clearly.
