# Git Best Practices for Teams

Git is the backbone of modern software development. Here are best practices to keep your repository clean and your team productive.

## Commit Messages

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
✅ Good:
feat: add user authentication with JWT
fix: resolve memory leak in image processor
docs: update API documentation for v2 endpoints

❌ Bad:
update
fixed stuff
wip
```

## Branching Strategy

### Git Flow

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch
- `feature/*`: New features
- `hotfix/*`: Emergency fixes
- `release/*`: Release preparation

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Start a feature
git checkout -b feature/user-profile develop

# Work on the feature
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement user profile page"

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff feature/user-profile
```

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Interactive rebase to clean up commits
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Stash changes temporarily
git stash save "work in progress"
git stash pop

# Cherry-pick a specific commit
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# View file history
git log --follow <filename>
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. Keep PRs small and focused
2. Write descriptive titles and descriptions
3. Link related issues
4. Ensure CI passes
5. Request reviews from appropriate team members

## Don'ts

- Don't commit directly to main
- Don't force push to shared branches
- Don't commit sensitive data
- Don't make huge commits
- Don't ignore merge conflicts

## .gitignore Essentials

```
node_modules/
.env
.DS_Store
*.log
dist/
build/
coverage/
```

Master these practices and your team will thank you!
