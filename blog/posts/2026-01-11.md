# CSS Grid vs Flexbox: Which Should You Use?

Both CSS Grid and Flexbox are powerful layout tools, but they excel in different scenarios. Let's explore when to use each.

## Flexbox: One-Dimensional Layouts

Flexbox is perfect for layouts in a single direction (row or column).

### Best Use Cases

- Navigation bars
- Card layouts
- Centering content
- Distributing space between items

### Example

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

## CSS Grid: Two-Dimensional Layouts

Grid shines when you need control over both rows and columns.

### Best Use Cases

- Page layouts
- Image galleries
- Complex dashboard layouts
- Magazine-style designs

### Example

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-gap: 2rem;
}
```

## Can They Work Together?

Absolutely! Use Grid for the overall page structure and Flexbox for components:

```html
<div class="grid-layout">
  <header class="flex-header">...</header>
  <main class="grid-content">...</main>
  <aside class="flex-sidebar">...</aside>
</div>
```

## Quick Decision Guide

**Use Flexbox when:**
- Working with a single row or column
- Content size should determine layout
- Need to center items easily

**Use Grid when:**
- Creating complex 2D layouts
- Need precise control over rows and columns
- Building responsive layouts without media queries
