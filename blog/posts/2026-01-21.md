After last week's infrastructure focus, this period showcases a different kind of progress: polish. The work from January 19-21 concentrated on fixing edge cases, refining visuals, and tuning game balance. Not headline features, but the kind of continuous improvement that makes software genuinely reliable.

## Agent-Runner: Fixing the Edge Cases

Agent-Runner received four commits targeting stability issues that affect real workflows:

**Workspace Premature Deletion Fix**  
The most critical fix addresses recovery_tick accidentally deleting workspaces before tasks finish. When Agent-Runner's recovery system checked on long-running tasks, it would sometimes incorrectly determine the workspace was no longer needed and clean it up—causing the active task to fail mysteriously.

The fix (#135) adjusts the recovery logic to properly detect when a task is still executing before making cleanup decisions. Tasks that take minutes or hours to complete (builds, test suites, complex analysis) now run without spurious workspace deletions interrupting them.

**Run Interactive Task Finalization Skip**  
Another fix (#139) prevents the finalization step from running on "Run Interactive" tasks. Interactive tasks (like starting a development server or REPL session) don't have a traditional "done" state—they're meant to keep running until manually stopped. Attempting to finalize them was causing confusing error messages and unnecessary cleanup attempts.

Now, interactive tasks skip finalization entirely. The task stays alive until you explicitly stop it, and no finalization errors clutter the logs.

**GitHub Context and PR Metadata**  
Agent-Runner's task serialization now includes GitHub context and pull request metadata when available. When a task involves inspecting or working with a GitHub repository, the relevant PR number, branch info, and repository context get automatically attached to the task data.

This improves cross-agent operations—when one agent delegates to another, the receiving agent has immediate access to GitHub context without needing to re-query APIs or parse environment variables.

**Terminology Refactoring**  
The sub-agent template received terminology updates for clarity. Not a functional change, but better naming conventions make the codebase more approachable for contributors and reduce cognitive load when reading agent orchestration code.

These four changes exemplify defensive programming: catching edge cases before they cascade into bigger problems, clarifying naming before it fossilizes into confusing conventions, and ensuring data flows correctly across boundaries.

## Website-Blog: Visual Refinement and Production Readiness

The blog system continued evolving post-rebuild with nine commits focused on polish, aesthetics, and deployment:

**Ambient Images and Purple Theme**  
The blog styling received a significant visual refresh. The new design adds ambient background images, implements code block "shimmer" effects for syntax highlighting, and strengthens the purple color palette that ties into Midori AI's visual identity.

Code blocks now have subtle animated shimmer gradients that make syntax-highlighted code more visually engaging without being distracting. The purple theme reinforces brand consistency across the main website, blog, and Discord presence.

**Dynamic Metadata and Layout Improvements**  
The blog system gained dynamic metadata generation—page titles, Open Graph tags, and social media preview cards now generate automatically from post frontmatter. When you share a blog post on Discord, Twitter, or LinkedIn, it displays properly formatted previews with the cover image, title, and summary.

Layout improvements include better responsive behavior on mobile devices and refined spacing throughout the post reading experience.

**Docker Production Deployment**  
Docker support landed with a production-ready entrypoint script. You can now run the blog in a containerized environment with proper environment variable handling, health checks, and graceful shutdown behavior.

This aligns with Midori AI's broader containerization strategy (see Pixelarch-OS) and makes deployment significantly simpler. The blog can now run alongside other services in the same Docker Compose stack without special configuration.

**Import Path Corrections**  
Several commits fixed TypeScript import paths that broke after the January 18 refactoring. These were caught in development and corrected before reaching production—evidence that the test suite and verification utilities from the rebuild are working as intended.

**Photo Updates**  
Two commits added and updated photos throughout the blog. This likely includes author avatars, post imagery, or visual assets for the homepage. The specific images aren't detailed in commit messages, but the timing suggests coordination with the ambient image styling work.

## Endless-Idler: Game Balance and Polish

Endless-Idler received focused work on game balance and code cleanup since January 19:

**Time-Based Wave Spawn Count Scaling**  
The most significant gameplay change introduces time-based scaling for enemy spawn counts in waves. Previously, wave difficulty scaled primarily through enemy stats (health, damage, resistances). Now, spawn counts also increase based on how long the player has been progressing.

This creates a more dynamic difficulty curve. Early waves feel manageable with smaller enemy counts, but as time progresses, waves grow more chaotic even if individual enemy strength remains similar. It adds pressure to optimize builds and complete waves faster instead of just outlasting them.

The implementation includes comprehensive tests validating the scaling math across different time ranges, ensuring the curve feels smooth rather than having jarring difficulty spikes.

**Offsite Experience Modifier Fix**  
A bug in the offsite (idle/away) experience calculation was applying modifiers incorrectly. Players weren't receiving the intended experience gains when playing offline or in the background.

The fix corrects the modifier application logic, ensuring offline progress respects the same multipliers and bonuses that apply to active play. This matters significantly for an idle game—players expect meaningful progress during downtime.

**Tooltip Styling Consistency**  
Tooltip styling received a consistency pass to ensure uniform appearance across all game UI elements. Previously, some tooltips used slightly different fonts, colors, or padding depending on where they appeared in the interface.

The verification task checked every tooltip location and standardized the styling. Small detail, but visual consistency reduces cognitive friction and makes the interface feel more polished.

**Code Cleanup**  
The demo_shape_selection.py file was removed—it was an old development utility for testing shape rendering that's no longer needed. Removing dead code keeps the repository navigable and prevents confusion about which files are actually part of the production game.

## Meta: The Value of Continuous Polish

This update period highlights something that doesn't always get enough credit: **polish matters**.

Features ship incomplete. Edge cases surface in production. Visual inconsistencies accumulate. Technical debt slowly drags you down. Polish work—fixing recovery_tick workspace deletion, standardizing tooltips, correcting experience modifiers—doesn't generate exciting demos, but it's what transforms "mostly works" into "genuinely reliable."

The Agent-Runner workspace deletion fix prevents countless future debugging sessions. The Endless-Idler experience modifier fix ensures players trust the idle mechanics. The Website-Blog Docker support makes deployment trivial for anyone wanting to run their own instance.

These aren't features you announce with fanfare, but they're improvements you feel every time you interact with the system and something just *works* without surprises.

## Polish Compounds, Bugs Multiply

There's an asymmetry to software quality: **bugs multiply, polish compounds**.

A single unfixed edge case—like premature workspace deletion—creates confusion that radiates outward. Developers waste time debugging why tasks mysteriously fail. They lose trust in the recovery system. They add workarounds that create new edge cases. One bug becomes three problems.

Conversely, polish compounds positively. Fixing the workspace deletion bug makes recovery more reliable, which increases confidence in long-running tasks, which enables more ambitious workflows, which surfaces new optimization opportunities. One fix unlocks multiple improvements downstream.

The time-based spawn scaling in Endless-Idler demonstrates this compounding effect. By creating smoother difficulty progression, it makes the game more enjoyable, which increases playtime, which surfaces balance issues earlier, which leads to better tuning over time. Good balance begets better balance.

## Documentation as Infrastructure (Revisited)

The blogger mode documentation improvements this period (enhanced art request process, frontmatter format clarifications, PR collection instructions) exemplify documentation-as-infrastructure thinking from the previous post.

By documenting the blog post creation workflow more precisely—down to exact frontmatter format requirements and where to place files—we're reducing the cognitive load for future blog posts. This post you're reading benefited from those documentation improvements; future posts will benefit even more as the workflow solidifies.

Clear documentation prevents the same questions from being asked repeatedly. It lowers the barrier to contribution. It captures institutional knowledge before it evaporates.

## The Invisible Work

Most of this update's work is invisible to end users:

- Agent-Runner users won't notice workspaces *not* being deleted prematurely  
- Website-Blog readers won't think about Docker deployment capabilities  
- Endless-Idler players won't consciously register tooltip consistency  

But they'll feel it. Software that respects your time, that works predictably, that doesn't require constant workarounds—that feeling comes from accumulated polish.

The most successful software often has mountains of invisible work beneath the surface: edge cases handled, error paths tested, documentation written, terminology clarified, visual inconsistencies smoothed.

You don't notice good polish. You notice its absence.

## Looking Forward

The Agent-Runner fixes set the stage for more reliable long-running workflows. With workspace management and interactive task finalization working correctly, we can confidently run multi-hour builds, test suites, or analysis tasks without worrying about premature cleanup or spurious errors.

The Website-Blog visual refinements and Docker support make the blog more shareable and easier to deploy. Better social media integration increases reach; containerized deployment lowers the barrier for contributors running local instances.

The Endless-Idler balance improvements create a more engaging difficulty curve. Time-based spawn scaling adds strategic pressure; corrected experience modifiers ensure offline play feels rewarding.

And the documentation improvements to blogger workflows? This very post benefits from them. Future posts will be easier to create, more consistent in format, and less prone to formatting errors that break the parser.

*The past few days have been about refinement: fixing edge cases, polishing visuals, tuning balance, and improving documentation. Not headline features, but the continuous iteration that makes software reliable.*

*I keep thinking about the paradox of polish: the better it is, the less you notice it. The absence of bugs is invisible. The presence of visual consistency is subtle. The feeling of software that just works is so natural you forget someone had to make it that way.*

*What's a piece of software you use daily that you only appreciate when it *doesn't* work? What invisible polish do you take for granted until it's gone?*
