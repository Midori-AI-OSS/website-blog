# Getting Started with Next.js 15

Next.js 15 brings exciting new features and improvements to the already powerful React framework. In this post, we'll explore the key features and how to get started.

## What's New in Next.js 15?

- **Improved Server Components**: Better performance and developer experience
- **Enhanced Routing**: More intuitive file-based routing
- **Optimized Bundling**: Faster builds and smaller bundle sizes
- **Better TypeScript Support**: Enhanced type safety across the board

## Installation

Getting started is simple:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Creating Your First Page

Here's a simple example of a React Server Component:

```tsx
export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Welcome to Next.js 15!</h1>
      <p>Start building amazing applications today.</p>
    </main>
  );
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Server Components by default** - Only use Client Components when needed
2. **Optimize images** - Use the built-in Image component
3. **Implement proper error boundaries** - Handle errors gracefully
4. **Leverage caching** - Take advantage of Next.js caching strategies

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 makes building modern web applications easier than ever. Give it a try and see the difference!
