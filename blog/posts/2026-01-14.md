# Understanding React Hooks

React Hooks revolutionized how we write React components. Let's dive into the most commonly used hooks and their practical applications.

## useState Hook

The `useState` hook is the foundation for managing component state:

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

## useEffect Hook

For side effects and lifecycle management:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
}, [count]);
```

## Custom Hooks

Create reusable logic with custom hooks:

```javascript
function useLocalStorage(key, initialValue) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(() => {
    return localStorage.getItem(key) || initialValue;
  });
  
  useEffect(() => {
    localStorage.setItem(key, value);
  }, [key, value]);
  
  return [value, setValue];
}
```

## Common Patterns

- **Data Fetching**: Use hooks to fetch and manage async data
- **Form Handling**: Simplify form state management
- **Animation**: Create smooth animations with hooks

Hooks make React code more readable and maintainable!
