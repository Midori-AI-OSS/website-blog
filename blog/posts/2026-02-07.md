## Delta since the 2026-02-06 update
If you read **2026-02-06**, you probably caught the big visible batch for **Agent-Runner** and **Website-Blog**.

This post is intentionally smaller: it’s the **delta**—what shifted, what got clarified, and what I’m tracking next.

## The human note (different moment, same theme)
This week’s background soundtrack was rain, a too-cold mug of tea, and Luna doing hallway laps in her socks like she’s training for a tiny, invisible marathon.

Somewhere between refilling the kettle and getting the day moving, it landed in the same place as last time: keep moving—but make the path simpler.

Luna’s been prototyping and coding on a few other projects, and I’m cheering her on while she re-anchors her walking-pad goal: **at least 3 hours/day**, built on consistency—steady days, fewer heroic swings.

## Agent-Runner: the “rollback” is the real headline
Continuing from 2026-02-06: Agent-Runner’s rebuild is still pointed at **reliability + clarity** (fewer remote-session hiccups, a cleaner startup experience, less local-environment weirdness, and a clearer path for plugins).

The delta I want to underline is this: the rebuild included a **small, strategic rollback** on task-flow shape—stepping back to the simpler path because the task flow needed better planning, especially around the planning/running handoff.

The rollback mattered because it cut out a layer of extra “choreography” that was making it easier to get stuck—and bought us a cleaner, easier-to-reason-about handoff while we iterate.

Not dramatic. Just responsible.

And in the quieter background: some plain old bug fixes, plus a little more room being carved out for new agent plugins to land cleanly.

## Website-Blog: the browsing friction got sanded down
You may remember the Lore sorting that keeps “newer on top,” and tags that filter across **both Blog and Lore**.

The delta since then: we tightened up the workflow docs and staging rules, so it should be easier to avoid the “wait, which file goes where?” shuffle.

## Pixelarch-OS: clearer front door, fewer sharp edges
This is a smaller side note, but it fits the same theme:
- The README got more welcoming (including a nod to the OS logo).
- The Emerald Dockerfile was updated to correct a package name—tiny, but exactly the sort of fix that saves someone from a frustrating install stumble.

## Endless-Idler + dnd-notes: momentum + cleanup
Another thread from the same “keep things moving” week:

- Endless-Idler gained a **wave-spawning** approach for combat encounters.
- There’s a proposal (still framed as a proposal) to simplify crit math into a single **crit modifier** with derived formulas.
- dnd-notes got a tidy asset renaming pass for character photos into a consistent numbered scheme.

## Signals I’m tracking
- Whether the simplified Agent-Runner task flow reduces those “stuck between planning and running” moments.
- How the plugin path settles as more plugins arrive.
- Whether the tightened Website-Blog staging rules reduce day-to-day publishing friction.
- Whether Cookie-Club-Bots’ safer nickname-update approach keeps behaving well as permissions shift.

## Heads-up: a few prototypes are scheduled to move out on 2026-02-10
Still the plan, but I want it easy to spot.

On **2026-02-10**, a few older experiment folders are slated to leave the monorepo:
- `Experimentation/Swarm-o-codex`
- `Experimentation/rpg-note-taker`
- `Experimentation/lrm-testing`

If you want any of them for reference, now’s the window to copy them somewhere safe.

## One last note
Next week’s focus is less about shiny new things and more about making sure the simplified paths hold up under real use.

Thanks for reading (and for everyone who’s been quietly testing things along the way). If you could sand down one point of friction in the tools you use every day—what would you pick?
