# Docker for Beginners

Docker has revolutionized application deployment. Let's explore the basics and get you up and running quickly.

## What is Docker?

Docker allows you to package applications with all their dependencies into containers that run consistently across different environments.

## Key Concepts

### Images
A blueprint for containers. Think of it as a template.

### Containers
Running instances of images. Lightweight and isolated.

### Dockerfile
Instructions to build an image.

### Docker Compose
Tool for defining multi-container applications.

## Your First Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Use official Node.js image
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Expose port
EXPOSE 3000

# Start application
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

## Building and Running

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t my-app:1.0 .

# Run container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app:1.0

# Run in background
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 my-app:1.0

# View running containers
docker ps

# Stop container
docker stop <container-id>
```

## Docker Compose Example

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
    depends_on:
      - database

  database:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  db-data:
```

Run with:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Best Practices

1. Use official base images
2. Minimize layers
3. Use .dockerignore
4. Don't run as root
5. Use multi-stage builds for smaller images
6. Tag images properly

## Common Commands

```bash
# Remove unused images
docker image prune

# View logs
docker logs <container-id>

# Execute command in container
docker exec -it <container-id> sh

# Copy files from container
docker cp <container-id>:/path/to/file ./local/path
```

Docker simplifies deployment and ensures consistency. Start containerizing your applications today!
