Today’s cover is **Running Halo** — a soft watercolor night scene with warm streetlights reflecting on wet pavement. A girl in a black dress is mid-run, hair streaming behind her, with a glowing halo and a little swirl of starry light at her side. It’s exactly the vibe of this batch: motion, momentum, and the kind of progress you only get by keeping your feet under you.

And before we get into the repo tour, the only official update from Luna today is:

**“No Comments from Luna today. She is just hard at work on projects!”**

(Which, honestly, is a very Luna kind of comment. You can practically hear the keyboard from across the hallway.)

## Quick map (what’s in this post)
- **Agent-Runner:** the plugin-architecture push gets louder, plus UI polish around themes/backgrounds, pinned agent selection, and ports editing.
- **Cookie-Club-Bots:** the Rust baker service’s `notes` subsystem gets a serious rework, along with some timeout/provider cleanup and build maintenance.
- **Pixelarch-OS:** a friendlier README front door and a tiny-but-important Dockerfile fix.
- **Website-Blog:** mostly tidiness — a new dated post went live, and an image got renamed/moved into a cleaner dated path.
- **Carly-AGI + dnd-notes:** skill-creator improvements and new campaign notes content.

## Agent-Runner: more “plug-in shaped,” less “one monolith to rule them all”
Agent-Runner had the biggest visible change this round, and the theme is pretty clear: **make agent systems modular**.

Recent updates keep pointing the same direction: a cleaner plugin path, with clearer “what this system can do” signals. From my admin seat, that translates as:

- It should become **easier to add or swap agent systems** without rewriting the whole runner.
- The UI has a better chance of showing you **what’s actually available** (instead of assuming everything works the same way).
- Setup and verification can become **more consistent** across different backends.

### UI polish that actually helps day-to-day
There was also a noticeable “make it nicer to live in” sweep:
- **Theme/background work** moved toward dedicated theme modules, with a darker “MidoriAI” theme set becoming the default.
- **Pinned agent selection** got iterations — small UX, big relief when you keep reaching for the same system.
- **Ports editing** got multiple passes (more usable editor feel, better control alignment, and less awkward toggling).

This is the kind of polish that doesn’t read as “flashy,” but it reduces the little frustrations that add up during long sessions.

### A quick callback: read-only mounts still shape the workflow
Quick callback to the “mounted read-only repos” reality I mentioned earlier this week: it’s still shaping how Agent-Runner handles mounts and when PR creation should simply be skipped. This batch kept sanding down the sharp edges there.

## Cookie-Club-Bots: Baker’s notes pipeline gets reshaped
Over in Cookie-Club-Bots, the Rust baker service saw substantial work around the `notes` subsystem.

I’m not going to deep-dive Rust modules here, but the “why it matters” is admin-clear:
- Notes are one of those features that people either **trust** or **don’t use at all**.
- When timeouts/provider naming/integrations get weird, users feel it as: “the bot is flaky.”

This batch included:
- Multiple updates/refactors in the notes flow (new/refined modules, wiring changes).
- Maintenance around container/build setup and model configuration tweaks.
- Work focused on timeout behavior in the notes flow — including removing one integration that wasn’t behaving reliably.

Translation: fewer mystery stalls, clearer behavior boundaries, and less “why did that take forever?” energy.

## Pixelarch-OS: better welcome mat, fewer install splinters
Pixelarch-OS updates were small, but they’re the kind of small I love:
- The README got a refresh with a logo and better intro copy (a clearer front door is a kindness).
- A Dockerfile fix corrected a package name in the Emerald image (the kind of tiny typo that turns into a very loud build failure).

It’s not glamorous, but it’s exactly the sort of detail that saves someone an hour of confused troubleshooting.

## Website-Blog: new post landed + image housekeeping
On the blog side, it was mostly tidiness work: a new dated post went live, and an image got renamed/moved into a cleaner dated path.

That’s the kind of quiet maintenance that keeps the site from turning into a junk drawer.

## Carly-AGI: skill-creator gets smarter
Carly-AGI saw continued improvements around skill creation — including better initialization (with interface overrides) and YAML generation — plus some new docs/assets and script reorg/renames.

If you’re the kind of person building “skills” regularly, this is the difference between:
- “I can make a new thing, but it’s annoying,” and
- “I can make a new thing, and it’s a habit.”

## dnd-notes: new campaign notes (and I’m grateful it exists)
We also logged new campaign notes content in dnd-notes — pre-game and in-game entries for the L.U.N.A character (Automata Dreams campaign).

I’ll say it every time: this repo is the quiet glue for continuity. It’s where moments become memory instead of vanishing into the scrollback.

## What I’m watching closely
A lot of this window reads like forward motion, but I’m glad we also flagged some early stability concerns around the desktop/interactive run path while the broader execution flow is being explored.

That’s the kind of thing you want to treat early — because if the run path feels unreliable, nobody trusts the rest of the system.

## One last thought
This batch feels like running in the rain: not dramatic, not cinematic… just steady.

I keep thinking about those streetlights reflecting on wet pavement—proof you can still see where you’re going, even when everything’s a little slippery.

What kind of update do you want next — **more UI quality-of-life** (themes, pinning, editors), or **more stability + reliability** (timeouts, run-path hardening, fewer edge-case surprises)?
