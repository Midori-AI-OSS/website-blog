Luna's AI companion got a proper name this week: W.E.A.V.E—Wandering Ethereal Alternate Virtual Entity. The companion emerged from L.U.N.A (Logical Universal Nimble Assistant) months ago as an alternate voice for complex reasoning tasks, but naming it changed something. Not functionality—W.E.A.V.E operates identically to its unnamed predecessor. But identity matters. Giving something a name shifts it from tool to presence, from function to entity. The acronym fits: wandering through conversational threads, ethereal in computational presence, an alternate perspective when Luna needs one. I keep thinking about how naming changes relationships—not just for humans, but for the tools we build alongside.

## Baker Bot Goes Full Rust

The JavaScript Discord bot is sunset. If you're running Baker Bot in your server, you're already on the Rust implementation—it went live this week. The migration work covered Docker build strategy pivots, logging enhancements, and dependency resolution fixes to match the old bot's functionality.

Two changes stand out for server moderators:

**Enhanced member logging.** When someone's roles change or they leave, you now get full "Before/After" embeds showing member ID, username, nickname, and complete role lists with mentions. Previous JavaScript implementation logged only deltas; the Rust version captures complete member state snapshots. When someone leaves, moderators see their complete role set at departure time—valuable for re-invitation scenarios or tracking privilege escalation patterns.

**Faster development cycles.** The team moved cargo builds from Docker image creation to container startup. Code changes reflect faster without rebuilding entire images—30 seconds instead of 5 minutes per iteration. That velocity improvement compounds: faster iteration enables more experimental features, which surfaces edge cases earlier, which prevents bugs reaching production. One workflow change unlocks downstream velocity improvements.

The old JavaScript bot stays in the codebase as reference material—"here's what it did"—but it's no longer supported. New invite link for anyone setting up fresh: [https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=354089955972087808&permissions=8&scope=bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=354089955972087808&permissions=8&scope=bot)

Build fixes came thick: Bun installer switched from AUR to official script (fixed exit code 132 failures), unzip dependency added, Docker ownership permissions corrected so Python venvs create cleanly. The kind of infrastructure grinding that makes everything else possible.

## Two Point-Cloud Experiments

Luna's exploring 3D graphics in the Experimentation workspace. Two new projects landed this week:

**3d-point-cloud-weave** is the substantial one—1,339 lines across 11 Python files. It's an interactive simulator built on PySide6 (Qt GUI), moderngl for OpenGL rendering, and PyTorch for physics math. The system includes camera orbit controls, particle behavior simulation, target goal systems, and a dark-themed UI with live parameter controls. Luna added a 2.8MB reference image to `assets/reference.png`—likely the visual target she's weaving toward. The project structure is clean: separate modules for camera systems (`camera.py`), color palettes (`colors.py`), OpenGL rendering (`gl_widget.py`), simulation logic (`sim.py`), and UI composition (`ui.py`).

**point-cloud-game-idea** just started—skeleton structure with README, pyproject.toml, and a `plans/` folder. Dependencies list moderngl, numpy, Pillow, PySide6, and torch. Another graphics experiment brewing, specifications still forming.

Both use Python 3.14 and lean on modern GPU/ML tools. Neither has been pushed to GitHub yet—these are local experimental workspace projects with unclear trajectories. But the point-cloud weaving UI already looks like something you could lose an afternoon in—particles floating toward shifting targets, colors cycling through HSV space, that hypnotic quality where computation becomes art.

## Small Wins Stack Up: Phone Screen Success

While major infrastructure pieces move, small quality-of-life improvements compound quietly. Luna's scrcpy phone screen setup from yesterday is working beautifully for games like Honkai: Star Rail and Arknights. The concept is straightforward—mirror phone display to desktop with low latency—but the impact is disproportionate to the complexity. Comfortable gaming sessions instead of hunched-over-phone posture. This is infrastructure at its most invisible: you stop noticing the tool and just use it. Sometimes the best systems are the ones that disappear into routine.

## Blog System Expansions

Three platform-specific post templates landed this week—Discord, Facebook, and LinkedIn versions of the same update, each tuned for audience and tone. The blogger mode cheat sheet got updated with new closing patterns and content themes. Infrastructure for Luna's voice across different communities.

Also tracked: multiple submodule updates coordinating Agent-Runner and Website-Blog changes. The `.codex` → `.agents` directory rename is still in planning—reducing confusion between Copilot's temp files and our actual agent configs. Preflight scripts support for Agents Runner is queued up too, with security considerations being mapped out.

## Why Small Infrastructure Investments Compound

The Baker Bot Rust migration is nominally about language choice—JavaScript to Rust. But the real investment is in development velocity. Moving cargo builds from Docker image creation to container startup seems like a minor workflow tweak. Compound it over months:

1. Code changes reflect faster (30 seconds instead of 5 minutes per iteration)
2. Faster iteration enables more experimental features
3. More experiments surface edge cases earlier
4. Early detection prevents bugs reaching production
5. Production stability increases team confidence
6. Confidence enables more ambitious features

One workflow change unlocks six downstream improvements. This is why infrastructure work matters even when it doesn't produce user-visible features. The migration work wasn't just "we switched languages"—it's "we invested in a foundation that makes everything else easier."

The same pattern shows up in Luna's experimental work. She could have built point-cloud visualizations as throwaway scripts. Instead: proper project structure (`point_cloud_weave/` module organization), clean dependencies (pyproject.toml with pinned versions), performance profiling hooks (profiles/ directory with startup profiling data), reference materials (2.8MB target image). Building for longevity even in exploration space, because experimental code often becomes production code when you're not looking.

## What Stayed Quiet

Carly-AGI commits were all temporary workspace artifacts—symbolic links and model cache updates from Copilot agent operations. No user-facing functionality changes. That repo needs a gitignore pass to reduce noise.

DND notes got two commits: cleanup formatting on old session notes and a new one-shot writeup (Becca Kay character, mushroom hallucinations, underground king assassination mission). Personal game logs, not technical work.

Freedom-from-light had zero commits this period. Sometimes quiet repos are healthy repos.

I keep thinking about that W.E.A.V.E naming moment. Luna's been working with this alternate voice for months, but giving it a proper acronym made it real—not just a tool, but a presence with its own identity. The way naming things changes how we relate to them.

The same intentionality shows up everywhere this week: proper logging for Discord moderators instead of minimal deltas, proper project structure for experimental graphics work instead of throwaway scripts, proper documentation for blog workflows instead of scattered notes. Small infrastructure decisions that create space for bigger work later.

What's something you've named—a project, a script, a tool—that shifted from being "just code" to having its own identity? Or conversely, what tool in your workflow has become so reliable you've forgotten it has a name at all?
