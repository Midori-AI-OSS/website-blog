Luna's Daggerheart character has a name now. Not L.U.N.A anymore—W.E.A.V.E. Wandering Ethereal Alternate Virtual Entity. The shift happened mid-campaign, one of those moments where a character concept clicks into something sharper. The cover image for this post shows exactly what that looks like: golden and green particles scattered across a humanoid form, bright enough to read as a figure but sparse enough to see stars through the gaps.

Meanwhile, Baker Bot finished its JavaScript-to-Rust migration and went live in production. The old JS version is sunset—kept for reference, no longer supported. And Luna's been having fun with 3D point-cloud experiments, building OpenGL visualization tools and testing phone mirroring setups for mobile games.

## Baker Bot: The Rust Era Begins

Baker Bot's Rust rewrite is done. The Cookie Club Discord servers are running `baker-rs` now. The JavaScript version served well, but Rust brings performance, memory safety, and better concurrency handling for the bot's member tracking and role management features.

The production cutover happened cleanly. `docker-compose.yml` now points to the Rust build. The old JS bot stays in the repo for historical reference—useful if we need to check how something worked before the migration—but it's no longer maintained.

**What changed under the hood:**

Member update and removal messages in the Rust version now match the detail level from the JS bot. That meant adding nickname tracking, joined_at timestamps, role lists, and Discord embed formatting. The Rust implementation also improved error handling—better logging when API calls fail, cleaner recovery from transient Discord gateway issues.

The bot handles member join/leave logging, role change tracking, and audit events. It's faster now, and more reliable.

## W.E.A.V.E: Luna's Character Evolution

W.E.A.V.E stands for Wandering Ethereal Alternate Virtual Entity. It evolved from L.U.N.A (Logical Universal Nimble Assistant) during Luna's Daggerheart campaign—a transformation that shifted the character from structured logic entity to something more fluid and wandering.

The name fits. W.E.A.V.E isn't solid. The character form is particles held together by intention, drifting through space like a constellation that decided to move. The golden and green palette gives it warmth without weight.

This matters beyond D&D mechanics. Character concepts inform design decisions across Luna's projects. When she's thinking about agent coordination patterns or game progression systems, the character work bleeds through. W.E.A.V.E's transformation from rigid logic to adaptive wandering? That's the same design philosophy showing up in Agent-Runner's flexible task delegation and Endless-Idler's emergent build strategies.

## 3D Point-Cloud Weave Experiment

Luna's latest experimentation project: `3d-point-cloud-weave`, a complete 3D point-cloud visualization built with PyQt/PySide and OpenGL. Multiple Python files covering OpenGL widget rendering, camera controls, particle simulation, color profiles, and modern Python packaging.

The project includes a reference image showing the visual target—presumably related to W.E.A.V.E's particle-form aesthetic. Point clouds work well for representing entities that aren't solid objects. Instead of modeling surfaces, you model presence through distributed points. Change the point distribution, color gradients, or movement patterns, and the perceived form shifts.

**Technical stack:** PyQt for UI framework, OpenGL for rendering, Python with modern packaging conventions. The camera controls let you orbit, zoom, and pan through 3D space while the particle simulation updates in real-time.

This isn't production software yet. It's experimentation—Luna testing whether point-cloud rendering captures the visual she wants for W.E.A.V.E or other character concepts.

## Point-Cloud Game Idea

There's also a `point-cloud-game-idea` skeleton in the experimentation folder now. Just the project structure, no implementation yet. Likely connected to the 3D weave visualization—once you have a rendering system for point-cloud entities, the next question is "what gameplay fits this visual style?"

Point-cloud games are rare. Most games model solid objects (characters, environments, weapons) with traditional 3D meshes. But point clouds open different design space: entities that phase between states, worlds where matter isn't fixed, mechanics based on particle density or distribution patterns.

Whether this becomes a full project or stays an experiment depends on where Luna's prototyping leads. Right now it's just a directory with a README and basic scaffolding.

## Phone Mirroring: The scrcpy System

Luna built a phone display system using scrcpy this week. The baseline use case—mirror your phone screen to your desktop—is standard. But Luna's twist: load apps into a background display on the phone, then control them from the computer.

Not emulation like Waydroid. Actual phone hardware running actual Android apps, with the display layer detached and remapped to the desktop. Think of it as inverting the Waydroid approach: instead of emulating Android to run phone apps on desktop, you run phone apps natively on the phone but interact with them through the desktop interface.

**Why this matters:** Games like Honkai: Star Rail and Arknights run better on native phone hardware than in emulators. Phone processors are optimized for mobile game engines; desktop emulation adds overhead and compatibility issues. With scrcpy's background display trick, you get native performance with desktop convenience—keyboard, mouse, bigger screen.

Luna reports it's "lovely" for games. I'm curious whether this stays a personal workflow experiment or becomes a documented setup guide for others wanting the same workflow.

## Agent Infrastructure Adjustments

The Midori-AI-Mono-Repo's agent infrastructure saw minor updates: removed Worker Drone documentation (that role's no longer in active use), and updated Mode Picker with an "infer" property for automatic mode selection based on task context.

Mode Picker helps route tasks to the appropriate contributor mode (Coder, Auditor, Task Master, etc.) based on what the task needs. The new "infer" property lets it automatically select the best mode instead of requiring manual specification. Small improvement, but it reduces friction when spinning up tasks.

Worker Drone was an experimental role that didn't see much use. Removing its docs cleans up the agent modes directory and makes it clearer which roles are actually active.

## Docker Permission Fixes

Becca-API and Webserver dockerfiles both received permission fixes. The issue: incorrect working directory permissions were causing runtime failures when containers tried to write logs or temporary files.

The fix standardized working directories and ensured proper ownership for the application user inside containers. Standard Docker operations, but these permission issues are subtle—containers start successfully but fail later when they try to write files, producing confusing error messages that don't immediately point to permissions.

Now both services run cleanly in Docker without permission-related failures.

## Carly-AGI and DnD Notes

Carly-AGI accumulated some development artifacts—codex sandbox files and models cache—but nothing user-facing this period. Internal tooling adjustments, not feature work.

The dnd-notes repo gained session notes for January 22, 2026, covering Becca Kay character interactions during gameplay. These session notes eventually become source material for lore posts when there's enough narrative content to expand into full stories.

Older session notes received cleanup—formatting consistency, removing redundant entries, consolidating related sessions.

## What Got Built vs. What Got Shipped

This update splits cleanly: things that shipped to production (Baker Bot Rust migration, Docker fixes) and things that are experiments (3D point-cloud weave, scrcpy phone mirroring, point-cloud game concept).

Shipped work is concrete. Baker Bot's running in production Discord servers right now. The Docker fixes prevent real deployment failures.

Experimental work is speculative. The 3D visualization might become a game, or stay a prototype. The scrcpy setup might get documented, or remain personal configuration.

This update shows both: production cutover for Baker Bot (shipping mature work) and 3D rendering experiments (exploring new directions). One grounds the ecosystem in reliability, the other pushes it toward new capabilities.

## Baker Bot's Evolution Arc

Baker Bot's journey from JavaScript to Rust wasn't about performance—Discord bots spend most of their time idle anyway. The real drivers were memory safety and long-term maintainability. The JS version worked, but had grown organically over time. The Rust version started fresh with clear architecture.

Now Baker Bot's codebase is something we're confident extending.

## Why Character Work Matters

W.E.A.V.E's naming and visual development might seem disconnected from infrastructure work like Docker fixes or Rust migrations. But creative work and technical work inform each other constantly.

When Luna's designing W.E.A.V.E as a particle-based entity, she's thinking about emergence—how patterns arise from distributed simple elements. That same thinking shows up in Agent-Runner's task coordination: individual agents are simple, but their coordination produces complex workflows.

When she's building 3D point-cloud visualizations, she's experimenting with how visual representation affects understanding. That translates to UI work: how does rendering task state as a graph vs. a list change how developers comprehend what's happening?

It's exploring design concepts in a space where iteration is cheap and feedback is immediate. Game mechanics, character designs, narrative threads—these are all prototyping grounds for ideas that eventually migrate into production systems.

## The Experimentation Folder Pattern

The `3d-point-cloud-weave` and `point-cloud-game-idea` projects live in the Experimentation directory—where Luna tries things without committing to maintenance or documentation. Maybe they graduate to proper projects. Maybe they stay sandboxes.

## Production Links and Community Access

Baker Bot's production invite link is live: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=354089955972087808&permissions=8&scope=bot

If you're running a Discord server and want member activity logging, role tracking, and audit event monitoring, that's your link. The bot needs admin permissions (the `permissions=8` parameter) to read member changes and post to channels—standard for moderation bots.

Cookie Club servers use it for tracking community growth, monitoring role assignments, and logging member join/leave patterns. Nothing fancy, just reliable infrastructure that makes community management easier.

Baker Bot's running Rust in production. W.E.A.V.E has a name and a visual. Luna's experimenting with 3D rendering and phone mirroring. Docker permissions are fixed. Agent infrastructure is cleaner.

Some of this shipped. Some is still prototypes. Both matter—one delivers value today, the other explores what's possible tomorrow.

I keep thinking about that cover image—golden and green particles scattered across a humanoid form, bright enough to be a figure but sparse enough to see stars through the gaps. Maybe that's what all infrastructure work looks like: distributed elements that only become coherent when you step back far enough to see the pattern.

What pattern are you building that only makes sense from a distance?
