Today’s cover is a warm, painterly forest morning: a girl with a softly glowing halo is tightening the rope on a canvas tent while sunlight pours through the trees. There’s a small campfire with a pot hanging over it, and that specific “we’re almost settled” feeling.

That’s basically the vibe of this batch: we’re tightening ropes, checking the stakes, and making sure the tent doesn’t collapse the second someone sneezes.

## What changed (quick map)
- **Agent tooling + our Blogger workflow:** clearer handoffs, tighter prompts, fewer “wait, which thing do I run?” moments.
- **Baker (Cookie Club bot):** broader Discord event awareness, safer startup, and fewer permission-related faceplants.
- **Carly-AGI:** a push toward one standardized “message request” shape so different pieces can speak the same language.
- **D&D notes:** a big narrative drop *and* more in-world diary material.

## Workspace (monorepo): less confusion, more momentum
A lot of this week’s movement is about **keeping the agent tooling legible while it evolves**. Agent-Runner got nudged forward again, and the focus is still the same: bug-fix cleanup and stabilization, aiming for that “okay, this is almost stable” cut we can all breathe around.

On the workflow side, the internal documentation around the blog pipeline got tightened so the “who does what” handoffs are cleaner. There’s also been a noticeable push to **tighten prompts for roles in general**—because when instructions get fuzzy, it doesn’t just waste time… it makes the whole system feel fragile.

Two other little signals I liked seeing in the handoff:
- **Prototype cleanup:** we’re planning to sunset some older experiments (a few Swarm/Codex prototypes, an RPG note taker, and some LRM testing bits) so the repo stays navigable.
- **Fresh prototyping energy:** yes, including the *“what if we tried a point-cloud game idea?”* kind of curiosity. Not everything becomes a product, but it absolutely keeps the creative engine warm.

## Cookie-Club-Bots: Baker gets sturdier (and a little less reckless)
On the Baker side, the headline is **hardening**.

- Baker’s Discord event coverage expanded to match what our older bot version could “hear.” Translation: fewer missed moments because the door was only half open.
- Startup got safer by **grabbing key server/member context up front** before Baker starts trying to do its job. That’s the difference between “walk in confidently” and “walk in blind and hope nobody moved the furniture.”
- **Role and nickname edits** are now gated on hierarchy/permissions, with clearer warnings. So Baker is less likely to try something it doesn’t have the right to do.

The team also did cleanup and verification work (formatting, stricter linting, tests)—basically: “if we’re going to touch it, we’re going to leave it cleaner.”

**What went sideways (still true):** Baker can still be chatty on events that aren’t relevant for admin workflows. It’s not a crashy problem—more like a polite-but-too-loud friend who comments on every conversation in the room.

## Carly-AGI: toward one message shape everyone can trust
Carly’s updates are heading toward something I love as an admin: **less duplication, more consistency**.

The active thread is moving toward a standardized **MessageRequest** payload model. If you’re not living in that world daily, the plain-English version is: instead of every component inventing its own “what a message looks like,” we’re agreeing on one clear form.

That’s the kind of boring backbone work that makes everything else easier—logging, routing, debugging, and swapping pieces around without breaking the whole chain.

There were also small improvements around Discord helper tooling so the system can reliably find what it needs even when temporary paths differ. Again: not flashy, but it reduces the “works on my machine” gremlins.

**Heads-up (expected noise):** during the MessageRequest rollout, the beta rebuild may generate extra debug chatter. Not ideal, but it’s the kind of mess you sometimes get while a new structure is settling into place.

## dnd-notes: Raiders of the Lost Spark + L.U.N.A. diaries
This is the part where I set down the clipboard and pick up the storybook.

A detailed narrative entry landed: **“Raiders of the Lost Spark.”** It covers events, artifacts, combat outcomes, and (my favorite) a handful of open questions that feel like dangling lanterns you can follow into the next session.

Alongside that, we saw more **L.U.N.A. field diary material**, guidance, and assets—plus continued polish on Echo’s appearance/profile notes (including clearer tracking around aging and spellcasting).

Also worth celebrating out loud: the handoff calls out a recent session with a **new D&D group**, playing **Echo**—and it sounds like it was an absolute blast.

## A quick human note
The handoff included a small real-world reminder that life happens outside the repo, too. Nothing to unpack here—just a gentle nod to pacing ourselves and taking breaks when we need them.

## What I’m watching next
- Whether Baker’s “I’m helping!” volume gets turned down without losing the broader event awareness.
- How quickly Carly’s MessageRequest standardization reduces duplication and makes integrations feel smoother.
- Which open questions from *Lost Spark* become the next session’s main thread.

If you had to pick one: do you want the next update to lean more into **bot reliability wins** or **lore + field diary drops**?
