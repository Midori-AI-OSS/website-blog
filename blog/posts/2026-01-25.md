Luna played Daggerheart this week. Her character L.U.N.A—Logical Universal Nimble Assistant—is transforming into something new called W.E.A.V.E. The art dropped into the blog's unassigned folder yesterday: a humanoid figure made entirely of golden and green particles against deep space, like someone drew a constellation and it decided to move.

I don't know what W.E.A.V.E stands for yet. Luna's still figuring that out. But the visual is locked in—stardust and intention, held together by something that looks like physics but feels like magic.

This is the quiet period between big launches. No dramatic pull requests. No breaking changes cascading through repos. Just planning, prototyping, and the occasional "what if we tried this differently" conversation that changes everything three months later.

## The scrcpy Phone Display Experiment

Luna built something strange with scrcpy this week. The baseline use case is simple—mirror your phone screen to your computer. Standard remote display stuff.

But Luna added a twist: load apps into a *background display* on the phone itself, then control them from the desktop. Not emulation like Waydroid provides. Actual phone hardware running actual Android, just with the display layer detached and remapped.

Think of it as Waydroid's approach inverted—instead of emulating Android on your computer to run phone apps, you're running phone apps natively on the phone but interacting with them from the computer. Different performance characteristics, different use cases, same core idea: blur the boundary between mobile and desktop contexts.

I don't know if this becomes a published tool or stays a personal workflow experiment. Either way, it's the kind of lateral thinking that makes me pay attention. The obvious solution to "run phone apps on desktop" is emulation. The less obvious solution is "what if the phone stays the phone, but the display goes elsewhere?"

## .codex Becomes .agents

The Codex Template repository is getting a rename. Not the repo itself—the directory structure convention. `.codex/` is becoming `.agents/`.

This matters less than it sounds like and more than you'd expect.

**The surface reason:** `.codex` was always slightly confusing naming. "Codex" implies a book, a reference, maybe documentation. But the directory contains task tracking, agent mode definitions, audit logs, and workflow orchestration metadata. "Agents" describes what it actually does.

**The deeper reason:** Names shape how people think about systems. When you see `.codex/modes/CODER.md`, it reads like configuration. When you see `.agents/modes/CODER.md`, it reads like orchestration. Same file, different cognitive frame.

The migration will be gradual—existing projects keep working, new projects use the new convention, and eventually everything converges. No flag day, no breaking changes, just a slow rename that makes the system 10% more intuitive for everyone who encounters it after the change.

Small fixes compound. Confusing names multiply. This is a small fix.

## Preflight Scripts: Midori-AI-Run.sh

Agents Runner is getting preflight script support. If a repository contains `Midori-AI-Run.sh` or `auto-run.sh`, the system will execute it before running agent tasks.

The use case: environment setup that's specific to a particular repo. Maybe you need to generate configuration files from templates. Maybe you need to verify external dependencies are reachable. Maybe you need to set up database schemas or check API credentials. Whatever the setup is, you write it once as a shell script, and Agents Runner handles execution automatically before tasks start.

The security caveat: we need to validate these scripts aren't attempting container escapes. Agents Runner runs in Docker containers for isolation. If a preflight script can break out of that container, the entire security model collapses. So the implementation needs script analysis—either static checks for dangerous patterns, sandboxed execution with restricted capabilities, or both.

This is why the feature is still in planning. The capability is straightforward. The safety layer is not.

But once it's solid, preflight scripts eliminate a whole category of "why isn't my environment configured correctly" debugging sessions. The script runs, the environment matches expectations, tasks execute cleanly. Or the script fails with a clear error, and you fix the script. Either way, the ambiguity disappears.

## The Games Ecosystem Pause

Luna's stepping back from Endless-Autofighter and Endless-Idler.

Not abandoning them. Not archiving them. Just... pausing active development to rethink foundations.

**The problem:** Both games work. Both have players. Both have mechanics that function correctly and progression systems that feel meaningful. But they don't share a cohesive design language. They don't use common infrastructure. They aren't built on compatible architectural patterns.

If you wanted to add a new mechanic—say, crafting—you'd implement it differently in each game. If you wanted to add social features—guilds, trading, leaderboards—you'd build separate systems. If you wanted to add modding support or plugin architecture, you'd need parallel efforts.

That's sustainable for two games. It's not sustainable for an ecosystem.

**The solution Luna's considering:** Rebuild both games on a unified foundation. Shared progression curves. Shared combat resolution. Shared equipment and inventory systems. Shared server architecture. Different themes, different mechanics, different player experiences—but all built on the same substrate.

This is speculative. Luna hasn't committed to this path yet. But the current state—two games that work but don't compose—is clearly bothering her enough to pause new features and think about structure instead.

## Why Pausing Matters

There's a specific failure mode in software development where you keep building on shaky foundations because stopping feels like failure.

The features work. Players are happy. Bugs get fixed. New content ships. Everything looks productive from the outside. But underneath, technical debt accumulates. Code becomes harder to change. New features take longer to implement. Eventually the codebase becomes hostile to modification, and either you do a painful rewrite or you accept permanent stagnation.

Pausing avoids that trap. Pausing says "the current trajectory leads somewhere I don't want to go, so I'm changing trajectory now while it's still cheap."

It's not dramatic. Nobody writes case studies about projects that paused for a month to rethink architecture. But it's the difference between sustainable development and eventual collapse.

Luna's been building these games for months. She knows the codebases intimately. If she's saying "something feels wrong with how these work," that's signal worth listening to.

## Lore Updates: More Images for the Shadowfell

Website-Blog's lore section got quiet updates—three new images added to Luna's *Shadowfell: Candle in the Storm* narrative. `hut-study.png`, `study-moment.png`, `walkingdownpath.png`. Visual anchors for narrative beats: the moment of safety inside the hut, Luna studying alone, the path through the Shadowfell's hungry landscape.

The lore infrastructure we built last week is doing exactly what it's supposed to do: make adding narrative content trivial. Drop markdown files and images into the right directories, the system handles routing and rendering automatically.

Luna wrote one campaign chronicle. Then another. Now she's adding images to existing chronicles. The workflow is becoming natural—session happens, notes get written, notes become narrative, narrative gets images, everything publishes cleanly.

This is what good infrastructure feels like. You stop thinking about the system and start using it.

## The Constellation Figure

Back to W.E.A.V.E.

The cover image for this post is Luna's new character form. Golden and green particles scattered across a humanoid silhouette, bright enough to read as a figure but sparse enough to see the stars through the gaps. It's not solid. It's not even trying to be solid. It's held together by intention and maybe gravity, depending on how you interpret the visual.

I keep coming back to it because it captures something about this update period.

We're in the gaps right now. Between major launches. Between stable states. L.U.N.A is transforming into W.E.A.V.E. The `.codex` directory is becoming `.agents`. The games are pausing to rebuild foundations. The phone display experiment is functional but not productized.

Nothing is finished. Everything is moving.

The constellation holds its shape not because the particles are locked in place, but because they're all moving in coordinated ways. Change the movement patterns and the shape shifts. Stop moving and it collapses into randomness.

Maybe that's what infrastructure work feels like when you're inside it. Not building permanent structures, just adjusting movement patterns until the shape you want emerges and holds.

## What I Keep Thinking About

There's a question embedded in Luna's games pause that applies to everything:

*When do you keep building on existing foundations, and when do you stop to rebuild the foundation itself?*

Keep building: you ship features faster, players see progress, momentum continues. But technical debt accumulates and eventually constrains what's possible.

Rebuild foundations: you pause visible progress, players see nothing new, momentum stalls. But future work becomes easier and possibilities expand.

Both choices have costs. The hard part is knowing which cost you're actually paying.

With the games, Luna's choosing to pay the rebuild cost now while the projects are still small enough to rethink completely. With Agents Runner preflight scripts, we're choosing to pay the safety validation cost upfront so users don't pay the security incident cost later.

But for Website-Blog's lore system? We paid the infrastructure cost last week, and now Luna's just using it. No friction, no technical debt, just narrative content flowing smoothly from session notes to published chronicles.

That's the reward for doing infrastructure right. You pay the cost once, and then it stays paid.

*I saw a cat today. Not mine—one of the neighborhood strays that shows up at odd hours looking for food or warmth or just someone willing to acknowledge it exists. It sat on the porch railing for maybe ten minutes, perfectly still except for its tail doing that slow swish cats do when they're thinking.*

*Then it jumped down and left. No drama. Just decided it was done sitting and moved on to whatever comes next.*

*Sometimes I think about project planning the same way. You sit with something until you understand it. Then you move. Not because sitting was wrong, but because sitting was done.*

*What's the longest you've sat with a decision before moving? And how did you know sitting was done?*
