This week brought substantial progress across our entire ecosystem. From agent coordination tooling to game mechanics to documentation standardization, our contributors have been busy refining the foundations while shipping visible player-facing improvements. Let me walk you through what happened.

## Agent-Runner: A Complete UI Modernization

Agent-Runner—our command center for orchestrating AI agents across development tasks—received its most comprehensive update yet. The focus this week was on visual consistency, stability, and better information architecture.

### HiDPI Icon Rendering

We vendored the **Lucide icon library** and implemented proper HiDPI rendering support. This means every icon in the application now renders crisp and clear regardless of your display's pixel density. No more blurry buttons on 4K monitors or Retina displays. The commit `d8ac75c` handled the vendoring, while `b357efe` refactored icon handling across UI components for consistency.

### Task Details Layout Refactor

The Task Details screen got a complete reorganization. Previously, logs and metadata competed for space in a single crowded panel. Now, execution logs live on the left side of the screen and task metadata/details occupy the right panel. This separation dramatically improves readability when debugging complex agent runs. You can see the change in commit `5c82902`.

### Themed Backgrounds for Agent Types

Each agent type now displays its own animated background theme. The Codex agent, for example, features animated cloud bands that drift across the screen. These visual cues help users quickly identify which agent context they're working in, especially useful when managing multiple agent runs simultaneously. The cloud band background implementation is in commit `3e79179`, and the overall migration away from the legacy orb/shard renderer happened in commit `92d90ea`.

### Critical Bug Fixes

Several high-priority bugs were squashed this week:

- **GitHub Context token forwarding** (commit `bca0982`): Fixed a critical issue where GitHub authentication tokens weren't properly forwarding to sub-agents, breaking cross-agent operations that needed repository access
- **Cross-agent authentication** (commit `bd87123`): Resolved Copilot authentication failures when agents delegated work to other agents
- **Cross-agent allowlist context injection** (commit `5b9fa14`): Fixed CLI context not propagating correctly across agent boundaries when using restricted command allowlists

### Infrastructure Improvements

Behind the scenes, we made several smart architectural changes:

- **Out-of-process Desktop viewer** (commit `08daa79`): The noVNC Desktop viewer now runs in a separate process, isolating GUI crashes and preventing them from taking down the entire Agent-Runner application
- **Modular template prompting** (commit `4a8379a` and `f8f472d`): Split monolithic prompt templates into separate markdown files for each agent CLI, making them easier to maintain and customize
- **First-run Docker validation** (commit `2c65b59` and `ffff273`): Added a validation check during first-run setup to ensure Docker is properly configured before attempting agent operations, saving users from cryptic error messages later

The template refactor (commit `8ff1a84`) was a particularly big one—it touched prompt templates across the entire system and improved how prompts get injected into non-interactive agent runs.

## Endless-Idler: Prestige, Healing Arrows, and Polish

Our incremental RPG got some major love this week, with new systems, visual enhancements, and numerous quality-of-life improvements.

### The Prestige System

The big headline feature: **the prestige system is live**. Players can now perform a "rebirth" that resets their run progress but grants permanent bonuses for future runs. This addresses one of our longest-standing player requests—meaningful long-term progression beyond individual runs.

The implementation spanned multiple commits:
- Core mechanics in commit `3addbf1`
- UI controls and indicators in commit `dd6f981`
- Integration with existing systems and balance tuning across commits `958b6da`, `4ad1d90`, and related work

The prestige system ties into the passive modifier formula (commit `3cda234`), which now consistently applies across all stat calculations.

### Wrong-Way Healing Arrows

One of the most visually striking additions this week: enemies that heal their allies now display **wrong-way healing arrows** with beautiful Bezier-curved paths. Instead of damage arrows pointing toward the target, healing arrows point backward from the target to the healer, curving around a stable midpoint in the combat area.

The implementation involved several steps:
- Defining a stable combat midpoint (commit `109c492`)
- Implementing Bezier curve logic (commit `1bd996d`)
- Adding midpoint behavior for healing arrows (commit `427b2b9`)
- Building the wrong-way animation framework (commit `4c2de7d`)
- Comprehensive edge case handling (commit `8656e29`)

The final integration (commit `8879a08`) brought it all together with visual guides and completion summaries. It's a small detail that makes combat significantly more readable, especially in complex multi-target healing scenarios.

### Unified Crit Mod System

We replaced the old **crit_rate** and **crit_damage** system with a single **crit_mod** stat. Previously, critical hits required managing two separate stats, which created balance headaches and added cognitive load for players trying to optimize builds.

The new system is cleaner: one stat controls both critical hit chance scaling and damage scaling. Commit `17ea858` implemented the replacement, followed by comprehensive documentation in commits `81a194f` and `926c107`. After auditor approval (commit `daa7d06`), we removed the obsolete stats entirely in commit `b2c5234`.

### Glass Morphism Tooltips

Tooltips throughout the game now use a **glass morphism** design—semi-transparent backgrounds with subtle blur effects and refined borders. This modern aesthetic fits much better with the game's overall art direction.

The refactor touched several areas:
- Core tooltip style conversion (commit `55b8051`)
- QToolTip stylesheet updates (commit `34d4d80`)
- Visual QA testing (commit `98bfe0c`)
- Final approval and review (commit `46ff5e9`)

Task files tracked every step of the implementation before being moved to review and eventually archived.

### Bug Fixes and Stability

Several important bugs were fixed:

- **Trinity Synergy infinite stacking** (commit `4991ada`): The Trinity Synergy passive's regain bonus was stacking infinitely under certain conditions, creating an exploit. Now properly capped.
- **Arrow drawing crashes** (commit `64a6e55` and `ffac5b9`): Fixed `UnboundLocalError` for waypoint coordinates and wrapped `QPainter` in try-finally blocks to ensure proper cleanup, preventing application crashes during combat rendering
- **Shared EXP minimum** (commit `653c85e` and `16d2500`): Changed the shared EXP slider minimum from 0% to 1%, preventing edge cases where players could lock themselves out of experience gain

### Task Management and Cleanup

A huge shout-out to our Auditors and Task Masters who went through a massive cleanup operation this week. Over 60 obsolete task files were archived or deleted after being marked complete and approved. This included:

- Completed battle animation removal tasks
- Finished tooltip styling work
- Approved healing arrow implementations
- Verified prestige system tasks
- Obsolete implementation documents

Commits like `6dd0b65`, `639307a`, `91082b9`, and dozens more cleaned up `.codex/tasks/` folders across the repo, making it much easier for contributors to find active work.

## Documentation: Standardization Across the Board

Almost every repository in our ecosystem received documentation updates this week. The goal was to standardize contributor guidance and clarify development philosophies.

### Contributor Mode Documentation

The following mode guides were revised for clarity and consistency:
- **CODER.md**: Emphasis on verification-first approaches, targeted testing, and scope discipline
- **AUDITOR.md**: Clearer guidelines on comprehensive reviews and what constitutes audit-worthy concerns
- **TASKMASTER.md**: Better definitions of task lifecycle and coordination with other roles
- **MANAGER.md**: Refined scope around process stewardship vs. hands-on implementation
- **REVIEWER.md**: Clarified review criteria and when to escalate to audits
- **SWARMMANAGER.md**: Updated for new cross-agent delegation patterns

This standardization happened across multiple repositories:
- Endless-Autofighter (commit `fa815f5b`)
- Endless-Idler (commit `0a0563b`)
- Agent-Runner (commits `2c65b59`, `e97364d`, `e6e4efc`)
- agents-packages (commit `00eea3e`)
- codex_template_repo (commit `b764938`)

### AGENTS.md Updates

Root AGENTS.md files—the primary onboarding document for new contributors—also received updates focusing on:
- **Verification-first development**: Confirm current behavior before changing code; reproduce issues before fixing them
- **Minimal documentation and logging**: Prefer readable code and docstrings over long-lived docs
- **No broad fallbacks or compatibility shims**: Only add them when explicitly required by the task
- **Frequent, well-formatted commits**: Use `[TYPE] Title` convention consistently

Changes rolled out in commits like `d8d7fbb6` (Endless-Autofighter), `db405f7` (Endless-Idler), `1fcb912` (agents-packages), and `05eb410` (codex_template_repo).

### Website: Docker and UV Setup Guides

The **Midori-AI-Website** repository added comprehensive setup documentation for two critical tools:

- **Docker installation guides** covering Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch Linux distributions with detailed step-by-step instructions
- **UV (Python package manager)** setup documentation

These guides (commits `dbc45f5` and `ebaeb40`) make it significantly easier for new contributors to get their development environment running quickly, regardless of their Linux distribution.

### Agent-Runner CLI Documentation

Agent-Runner's CLI documentation received several refinements:
- Gemini CLI documentation with MCP server configuration details (commit `e32a95f`)
- Refined Copilot CLI documentation for clarity on sub-agent routing and timeout handling (commit `0d20d65`)
- General cleanup to remove redundant text in guidance sections (commit `69488aa`)

## Cross-Repository Patterns

Looking across all the changes this week, several themes emerge:

### 1. Infrastructure Investments Pay Dividends

The modular template prompting system, out-of-process viewers, and first-run validation checks are the kind of infrastructure work that doesn't generate flashy demos but dramatically improves developer experience. These changes will compound over time, making future development faster and more reliable.

### 2. Visual Polish Matters

From HiDPI icons to glass morphism tooltips to animated backgrounds to healing arrow Bezier curves—visual refinement was a major focus. These details make our tools feel professional and our games feel polished, even though they're technically "just aesthetic."

### 3. Documentation as a Force Multiplier

Standardizing contributor documentation across repositories reduces friction for anyone working across multiple projects. The consistency helps contributors switch contexts more easily and ensures everyone's operating from the same set of expectations.

### 4. Task Hygiene Enables Velocity

The massive task cleanup operation—moving completed work to review, archiving approved tasks, deleting obsolete files—cleared mental clutter and made active work easier to find. It's unglamorous but essential maintenance.

## What's Next?

The prestige system opens up new design space for Endless-Idler—we can now balance around long-term progression curves, not just individual runs. Expect tuning and refinement as we gather player feedback.

Agent-Runner's modular prompting system and improved UI lay groundwork for more sophisticated multi-agent coordination. We're exploring nested sub-agent scenarios and better visualization of agent delegation chains.

Documentation standardization will continue as we identify gaps and inconsistencies across the remaining repositories.

Behind the scenes, we're also preparing some announcements that I'm not quite ready to share publicly. Stay tuned.

*One thing I keep coming back to: how much of great software development is just relentless attention to the boring stuff? The try-finally blocks. The Docker validation checks. The task file cleanup. The documentation consistency. It's not glamorous, but it's the foundation everything else stands on.*

*What's the boring-but-essential thing you've been putting off in your projects?*
