title: "Prototypes, Runner Fixes, and the Art of Removing Things"
summary: A new point-cloud experiment scaffold and related design docs landed in the monorepo, blog tooling was cleaned up, Cookie-Club-Bots iterated on Docker/build workflows and Rust bot logging, and Carly-AGI refreshed Codex auth/cache metadata.

The cover image is a quiet kind of progress: a campsite that’s already functional, with the “big” work done first so the next steps can be calm. That’s the tone of this update too—prototype energy on one side, and practical maintenance on the other.

**Sourcing note:** Everything in “What changed in the repos” is diff-derived from the evidence brief (commit hashes + described diffs). The “Requester notes” section is included verbatim because the requester asked for it.

## Requester notes (verbatim)

- Worked on prototyping
- Worked on bug fixes for the agents runner
- Brain stormed plans for a point cloud style game! That was fun!
- Maybe we need to make better prompting for the blogger and other roles... hmm...
- Plan removal of `Swarm o codex`, `rpg note taker`, `lrm testing`, from the Monorepo.

One-liner clarification: the “planned removal” item above is a stated plan, and it is not evidenced as executed within the diff window covered by this update.

**Point-cloud experimentation + game design planning:**

- `8e882e108530e0fc4d6c3dbbb8ee8ccc3ed6ce1c` introduced the `Experimentation/3d-point-cloud-weave/` prototype (Qt + ModernGL rendering pipeline, CLI entrypoint, simulation/UI scaffolding, plus `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, and `.python-version` set to 3.14).
- `f67c4e0691445f746f13567192f57eaf94492552` added a reference image at `Experimentation/3d-point-cloud-weave/assets/reference.png`.
- `f17297e10fd296f34bc5ad59def8ccb3ee3d0c7b` added a `.gitignore` for the point-cloud weave experiment outputs (`profiles/`, `renders/`, `*.pstats`).
- `26852a68ae4a6a8966a0e78f24f67aa92095c87c` removed trailing blank lines in three files under the weave experiment.
- `71e2997a47e9986820da944017a9fe2c6f379e45` scaffolded `Experimentation/point-cloud-game-idea/` with a `pyproject.toml` (declaring dependencies like `moderngl`, `numpy`, `pillow`, `pyside6`, `torch`, and `requires-python >=3.14`) and a README note to use `uv`.
- `939d7fc462c65b8d5511c90bd02dc0eaa0961bc8` added `Experimentation/point-cloud-game-idea/plans/inspo.markdown` with bullet-heaven / horde-survival references and takeaways, and also advanced the `Website-Blog` submodule pointer: `2ab212ed81f622632a356dad37a44cbb1662ecf9` → `427ebe1dd84fb45070a1f1d67d8f7a76fa46edb4`.
- `58e586895714c9d7b9b26204bcf163e86a11777b` added multiple planning/docs files under `Experimentation/point-cloud-game-idea/plans/`, including catalogs for cards/relics/characters, DoT/HoT rule notes, UI flow notes for reward selection, and a prototype plan for a stationary “point cloud game” style bullet-heaven.
- `cb2cfe83470407b8af85924e49d0d0a9171bddae` added `Experimentation/point-cloud-game-idea/plans/.gitkeep`.

**Agent/workflow configuration + blog tooling cleanup:**

- `de97be7b9dfaf11e433ca851091e1008105bd384` updated `.github/agents/mode-picker.md` to add `infer: true` and deleted `.github/agents/worker.md`.
- `6d1a0f83c1689bf8cafd5756af8d1cfcfd907713` made `.codex/blog/scripts/post_blog.sh` executable and removed three older queued “to be posted” drafts.

### Carly-AGI

- `071165f45a4999138b3f9a98f94eee0f7cf6174a` updated `.codex/auth.json` token-related fields and timestamps and refreshed `.codex/models_cache.json` metadata (`fetched_at` / `etag`). (Token contents are sensitive and are not reproduced here.)
- `db7cb19aca2246d6667c84a3c123a446d905e761` added six environment-specific pointer files under `Discord-Bot-Main/.codex/` for `apply_patch`, `applypatch`, and `codex-linux-sandbox` variants.

### Cookie-Club-Bots

**Container/build workflow iteration:**

- `efe590b2a138f60275475c4bb933a2887f682ae2` updated `docker-compose.yml` so the `baker` service builds from `./baker-rs` using its `Dockerfile` (fully switching the build target to the Rust baker).
- `eedc61db47f77d105be43228b21c9edbbe0b265d` removed a redundant `COPY` in `Dockerfile.baker` and adjusted `baker-rs/Dockerfile` to set PATH (bun/cargo bins) and ensure the application directory is owned by the non-root user.
- `36cd18c5bee607ec1ab05e129cb98f8c8ed3e6ea` moved `cargo build --release` from `baker-rs/startup.sh` into `baker-rs/Dockerfile`.
- `fb9f7c78f77d28ffafb3021a3d862ddc4cbd0fe0` later moved that build back into `baker-rs/startup.sh` to compile on container start (fresh builds on restart).
- `9781eecc9ac1e0b009afd20dc6efc2a8479c1808` added an ownership fix to the Becca-API and Webserver dockerfiles by explicitly `chown`ing the app directory after the copy step, preventing permission errors during `uv venv` / `uv sync`.

**CI/workflow and dependency fixes:**

- `12e355b29320c76a70175e7179e52053732b6f80` fixed indentation/syntax in `.github/workflows/pixelarch-ci.yml`.
- `887c7efa9a256deb40bc53630712239eb7710b2c` switched Bun installation in `Dockerfile.baker` to the official installer (`curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`) and updated PATH accordingly.
- `1dc19db9f3420959da7cf786e396371c5225e106` added `unzip` to `Dockerfile.baker` to prevent Bun installation failures.
- `476b9a584ed72fdbec1d27e5e48306a4b4721b24` enabled `workflow_dispatch` on `auto-merge-lunamidori.yml` and commented out the `pull_request` trigger.

**Rust baker bot: richer member event logging:**

- `324c87f8e6415542d7f387faca598d3ab60d02ea` enhanced member removal (“member left”) logging in `baker-rs/crates/events/src/lib.rs` with more detailed embed fields (nickname, joined_at, role list with mentions) and added error logging on send failures; it also included small command parsing cleanup in `baker-rs/crates/commands/src/lib.rs`.
- `639dea76ddc378639c3a679ef83358d413c05f4a` reworked “member update” messages to show structured “Before Update” vs “After Update” details (member ID, username, nickname, and role mentions), with a fallback when no old snapshot exists.
- `c578ffabb395c0769b98e2cb7aacb875bdddfd47` fixed a clippy warning by switching to `as_deref()` in `baker-rs/crates/events/src/lib.rs`.

A nice pattern shows up here: it’s not *just* building new things, it’s also investing in workflow changes intended to make the build-and-iterate loop feel less fragile over time. Prototypes tend to become more useful when the surrounding tooling is boring and dependable.
